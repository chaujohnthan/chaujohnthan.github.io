<h2>INTRODUCTORY</h2>
<p>In the wild end of a moorland parish, far out of the sight of
any house, there stands a cairn among the heather, and a little
by east of it, in the going down of the brae-side, a monument
with some verses half defaced.&nbsp; It was here that Claverhouse
shot with his own hand the Praying Weaver of Balweary, and the
chisel of Old Mortality has clinked on that lonely
gravestone.&nbsp; Public and domestic history have thus marked
with a bloody finger this hollow among the hills; and since the
Cameronian gave his life there, two hundred years ago, in a
glorious folly, and without comprehension or regret, the silence
of the moss has been broken once again by the report of firearms
and the cry of the dying.</p>
<p>The Deil’s Hags was the old name.&nbsp; But the place is
now called Francie’s Cairn.&nbsp; For a while it was told
that Francie walked.&nbsp; Aggic Hogg met him in the gloaming by
the cairnside, and he spoke to her, with chattering teeth, so
that his words were lost.&nbsp; He pursued Rob Todd (if any one
could have believed Robbie) for the space of half a mile with
pitiful entreaties.&nbsp; But the age is one of incredulity;
these superstitious decorations speedily fell off; and the facts
of the story itself, like the bones of a giant buried there and
half dug up, survived, naked and imperfect, in the memory of the
scattered neighbours.&nbsp; To this day, of winter nights, when
the sleet is on the window and the cattle are quiet in the byre,
there will be told again, amid the silence of the young and the
additions and corrections of the old, the tale of the
Justice-Clerk and of his son, young Hermiston, that vanished from
men’s knowledge; of the two Kirsties and the Four Black
Brothers of the Cauldstaneslap; and of Frank Innes, “the
young fool advocate,” that came into these moorland parts
to find his destiny.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER I—LIFE AND DEATH OF MRS. WEIR</h2>
<p>The Lord Justice-Clerk was a stranger in that part of the
country; but his lady wife was known there from a child, as her
race had been before her.&nbsp; The old “riding Rutherfords
of Hermiston,” of whom she was the last descendant, had
been famous men of yore, ill neighbours, ill subjects, and ill
husbands to their wives though not their properties.&nbsp; Tales
of them were rife for twenty miles about; and their name was even
printed in the page of our Scots histories, not always to their
credit.&nbsp; One bit the dust at Flodden; one was hanged at his
peel door by James the Fifth; another fell dead in a carouse with
Tom Dalyell; while a fourth (and that was Jean’s own
father) died presiding at a Hell-Fire Club, of which he was the
founder.&nbsp; There were many heads shaken in Crossmichael at
that judgment; the more so as the man had a villainous reputation
among high and low, and both with the godly and the
worldly.&nbsp; At that very hour of his demise, he had ten going
pleas before the Session, eight of them oppressive.&nbsp; And the
same doom extended even to his agents; his grieve, that had been
his right hand in many a left-hand business, being cast from his
horse one night and drowned in a peat-hag on the Kye-skairs; and
his very doer (although lawyers have long spoons) surviving him
not long, and dying on a sudden in a bloody flux.</p>
<p>In all these generations, while a male Rutherford was in the
saddle with his lads, or brawling in a change-house, there would
be always a white-faced wife immured at home in the old peel or
the later mansion-house.&nbsp; It seemed this succession of
martyrs bided long, but took their vengeance in the end, and that
was in the person of the last descendant, Jean.&nbsp; She bore
the name of the Rutherfords, but she was the daughter of their
trembling wives.&nbsp; At the first she was not wholly without
charm.&nbsp; Neighbours recalled in her, as a child, a strain of
elfin wilfulness, gentle little mutinies, sad little gaieties,
even a morning gleam of beauty that was not to be
fulfilled.&nbsp; She withered in the growing, and (whether it was
the sins of her sires or the sorrows of her mothers) came to her
maturity depressed, and, as it were, defaced; no blood of life in
her, no grasp or gaiety; pious, anxious, tender, tearful, and
incompetent.</p>
<p>It was a wonder to many that she had married—seeming so
wholly of the stuff that makes old maids.&nbsp; But chance cast
her in the path of Adam Weir, then the new Lord-Advocate, a
recognised, risen man, the conqueror of many obstacles, and thus
late in the day beginning to think upon a wife.&nbsp; He was one
who looked rather to obedience than beauty, yet it would seem he
was struck with her at the first look.&nbsp; “Wha’s
she?” he said, turning to his host; and, when he had been
told, “Ay,” says he, “she looks menseful.&nbsp;
She minds me—”; and then, after a pause (which some
have been daring enough to set down to sentimental
recollections), “Is she releegious?” he asked, and
was shortly after, at his own request, presented.&nbsp; The
acquaintance, which it seems profane to call a courtship, was
pursued with Mr. Weir’s accustomed industry, and was long a
legend, or rather a source of legends, in the Parliament
House.&nbsp; He was described coming, rosy with much port, into
the drawing-room, walking direct up to the lady, and assailing
her with pleasantries, to which the embarrassed fair one
responded, in what seemed a kind of agony, “Eh, Mr.
Weir!” or “O, Mr. Weir!” or “Keep me, Mr.
Weir!”&nbsp; On the very eve of their engagement, it was
related that one had drawn near to the tender couple, and had
overheard the lady cry out, with the tones of one who talked for
the sake of talking, “Keep me, Mr. Weir, and what became of
him?” and the profound accents of the suitor reply,
“Haangit, mem, haangit.”&nbsp; The motives upon
either side were much debated.&nbsp; Mr. Weir must have supposed
his bride to be somehow suitable; perhaps he belonged to that
class of men who think a weak head the ornament of women—an
opinion invariably punished in this life.&nbsp; Her descent and
her estate were beyond question.&nbsp; Her wayfaring ancestors
and her litigious father had done well by Jean.&nbsp; There was
ready money and there were broad acres, ready to fall wholly to
the husband, to lend dignity to his descendants, and to himself a
title, when he should be called upon the Bench.&nbsp; On the side
of Jean, there was perhaps some fascination of curiosity as to
this unknown male animal that approached her with the roughness
of a ploughman and the <i>aplomb</i> of an advocate.&nbsp; Being
so trenchantly opposed to all she knew, loved, or understood, he
may well have seemed to her the extreme, if scarcely the ideal,
of his sex.&nbsp; And besides, he was an ill man to refuse.&nbsp;
A little over forty at the period of his marriage, he looked
already older, and to the force of manhood added the senatorial
dignity of years; it was, perhaps, with an unreverend awe, but he
was awful.&nbsp; The Bench, the Bar, and the most experienced and
reluctant witness, bowed to his authority—and why not
Jeannie Rutherford?</p>
<p>The heresy about foolish women is always punished, I have
said, and Lord Hermiston began to pay the penalty at once.&nbsp;
His house in George Square was wretchedly ill-guided; nothing
answerable to the expense of maintenance but the cellar, which
was his own private care.&nbsp; When things went wrong at dinner,
as they continually did, my lord would look up the table at his
wife: “I think these broth would be better to sweem in than
to sup.”&nbsp; Or else to the butler: “Here,
M‘Killop, awa’ wi’ this Raadical
gigot—tak’ it to the French, man, and bring me some
puddocks!&nbsp; It seems rather a sore kind of a business that I
should be all day in Court haanging Raadicals, and get nawthing
to my denner.”&nbsp; Of course this was but a manner of
speaking, and he had never hanged a man for being a Radical in
his life; the law, of which he was the faithful minister,
directing otherwise.&nbsp; And of course these growls were in the
nature of pleasantry, but it was of a recondite sort; and uttered
as they were in his resounding voice, and commented on by that
expression which they called in the Parliament House
“Hermiston’s hanging face”—they struck
mere dismay into the wife.&nbsp; She sat before him speechless
and fluttering; at each dish, as at a fresh ordeal, her eye
hovered toward my lord’s countenance and fell again; if he
but ate in silence, unspeakable relief was her portion; if there
were complaint, the world was darkened.&nbsp; She would seek out
the cook, who was always her <i>sister in the Lord</i>.&nbsp;
“O, my dear, this is the most dreidful thing that my lord
can never be contented in his own house!” she would begin;
and weep and pray with the cook; and then the cook would pray
with Mrs. Weir; and the next day’s meal would never be a
penny the better—and the next cook (when she came) would be
worse, if anything, but just as pious.&nbsp; It was often
wondered that Lord Hermiston bore it as he did; indeed, he was a
stoical old voluptuary, contented with sound wine and plenty of
it.&nbsp; But there were moments when he overflowed.&nbsp;
Perhaps half a dozen times in the history of his married
life—“Here! tak’ it awa’, and bring me a
piece bread and kebbuck!” he had exclaimed, with an
appalling explosion of his voice and rare gestures.&nbsp; None
thought to dispute or to make excuses; the service was arrested;
Mrs. Weir sat at the head of the table whimpering without
disguise; and his lordship opposite munched his bread and cheese
in ostentatious disregard.&nbsp; Once only, Mrs. Weir had
ventured to appeal.&nbsp; He was passing her chair on his way
into the study.</p>
<p>“O, Edom!” she wailed, in a voice tragic with
tears, and reaching out to him both hands, in one of which she
held a sopping pocket-handkerchief.</p>
<p>He paused and looked upon her with a face of wrath, into which
there stole, as he looked, a twinkle of humour.</p>
<p>“Noansense!” he said.&nbsp; “You and your
noansense!&nbsp; What do I want with a Christian
faim’ly?&nbsp; I want Christian broth!&nbsp; Get me a lass
that can plain-boil a potato, if she was a whüre off the
streets.”&nbsp; And with these words, which echoed in her
tender ears like blasphemy, he had passed on to his study and
shut the door behind him.</p>
<p>Such was the housewifery in George Square.&nbsp; It was better
at Hermiston, where Kirstie Elliott, the sister of a neighbouring
bonnet-laird, and an eighteenth cousin of the lady’s, bore
the charge of all, and kept a trim house and a good country
table.&nbsp; Kirstie was a woman in a thousand, clean, capable,
notable; once a moorland Helen, and still comely as a blood horse
and healthy as the hill wind.&nbsp; High in flesh and voice and
colour, she ran the house with her whole intemperate soul, in a
bustle, not without buffets.&nbsp; Scarce more pious than decency
in those days required, she was the cause of many an anxious
thought and many a tearful prayer to Mrs. Weir.&nbsp; Housekeeper
and mistress renewed the parts of Martha and Mary; and though
with a pricking conscience, Mary reposed on Martha’s
strength as on a rock.&nbsp; Even Lord Hermiston held Kirstie in
a particular regard.&nbsp; There were few with whom he unbent so
gladly, few whom he favoured with so many pleasantries.&nbsp;
“Kirstie and me maun have our joke,” he would declare
in high good-humour, as he buttered Kirstie’s scones, and
she waited at table.&nbsp; A man who had no need either of love
or of popularity, a keen reader of men and of events, there was
perhaps only one truth for which he was quite unprepared: he
would have been quite unprepared to learn that Kirstie hated
him.&nbsp; He thought maid and master were well matched; hard,
bandy, healthy, broad Scots folk, without a hair of nonsense to
the pair of them.&nbsp; And the fact was that she made a goddess
and an only child of the effete and tearful lady; and even as she
waited at table her hands would sometimes itch for my
lord’s ears.</p>
<p>Thus, at least, when the family were at Hermiston, not only my
lord, but Mrs. Weir too, enjoyed a holiday.&nbsp; Free from the
dreadful looking-for of the miscarried dinner, she would mind her
seam, read her piety books, and take her walk (which was my
lord’s orders), sometimes by herself, sometimes with
Archie, the only child of that scarce natural union.&nbsp; The
child was her next bond to life.&nbsp; Her frosted sentiment
bloomed again, she breathed deep of life, she let loose her
heart, in that society.&nbsp; The miracle of her motherhood was
ever new to her.&nbsp; The sight of the little man at her skirt
intoxicated her with the sense of power, and froze her with the
consciousness of her responsibility.&nbsp; She looked forward,
and, seeing him in fancy grow up and play his diverse part on the
world’s theatre, caught in her breath and lifted up her
courage with a lively effort.&nbsp; It was only with the child
that she forgot herself and was at moments natural; yet it was
only with the child that she had conceived and managed to pursue
a scheme of conduct.&nbsp; Archie was to be a great man and a
good; a minister if possible, a saint for certain.&nbsp; She
tried to engage his mind upon her favourite books,
Rutherford’s <i>Letters</i>, Scougalls <i>Grace
Abounding</i>, and the like.&nbsp; It was a common practice of
hers (and strange to remember now) that she would carry the child
to the Deil’s Hags, sit with him on the Praying
Weaver’s stone, and talk of the Covenanters till their
tears ran down.&nbsp; Her view of history was wholly artless, a
design in snow and ink; upon the one side, tender innocents with
psalms upon their lips; upon the other, the persecutors, booted,
bloody-minded, flushed with wine: a suffering Christ, a raging
Beelzebub.&nbsp; <i>Persecutor</i> was a word that knocked upon
the woman’s heart; it was her highest thought of
wickedness, and the mark of it was on her house.&nbsp; Her
great-great-grandfather had drawn the sword against the
Lord’s anointed on the field of Rullion Green, and breathed
his last (tradition said) in the arms of the detestable
Dalyell.&nbsp; Nor could she blind herself to this, that had they
lived in those old days, Hermiston himself would have been
numbered alongside of Bloody MacKenzie and the politic Lauderdale
and Rothes, in the band of God’s immediate enemies.&nbsp;
The sense of this moved her to the more fervour; she had a voice
for that name of <i>persecutor</i> that thrilled in the
child’s marrow; and when one day the mob hooted and hissed
them all in my lord’s travelling carriage, and cried,
“Down with the persecutor! down with Hanging
Hermiston!” and mamma covered her eyes and wept, and papa
let down the glass and looked out upon the rabble with his droll
formidable face, bitter and smiling, as they said he sometimes
looked when he gave sentence, Archie was for the moment too much
amazed to be alarmed, but he had scarce got his mother by herself
before his shrill voice was raised demanding an explanation: why
had they called papa a persecutor?</p>
<p>“Keep me, my precious!” she exclaimed.&nbsp;
“Keep me, my dear! this is poleetical.&nbsp; Ye must never
ask me anything poleetical, Erchie.&nbsp; Your faither is a great
man, my dear, and it’s no for me or you to be judging
him.&nbsp; It would be telling us all, if we behaved ourselves in
our several stations the way your faither does in his high
office; and let me hear no more of any such disrespectful and
undutiful questions!&nbsp; No that you meant to be undutiful, my
lamb; your mother kens that—she kens it well,
dearie!”&nbsp; And so slid off to safer topics, and left on
the mind of the child an obscure but ineradicable sense of
something wrong.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weir’s philosophy of life was summed in one
expression—tenderness.&nbsp; In her view of the universe,
which was all lighted up with a glow out of the doors of hell,
good people must walk there in a kind of ecstasy of
tenderness.&nbsp; The beasts and plants had no souls; they were
here but for a day, and let their day pass gently!&nbsp; And as
for the immortal men, on what black, downward path were many of
them wending, and to what a horror of an immortality!&nbsp;
“Are not two sparrows,” “Whosoever shall smite
thee,” “God sendeth His rain,” “Judge
not, that ye be not judged”—these texts made her body
of divinity; she put them on in the morning with her clothes and
lay down to sleep with them at night; they haunted her like a
favourite air, they clung about her like a favourite
perfume.&nbsp; Their minister was a marrowy expounder of the law,
and my lord sat under him with relish; but Mrs. Weir respected
him from far off; heard him (like the cannon of a beleaguered
city) usefully booming outside on the dogmatic ramparts; and
meanwhile, within and out of shot, dwelt in her private garden
which she watered with grateful tears.&nbsp; It seems strange to
say of this colourless and ineffectual woman, but she was a true
enthusiast, and might have made the sunshine and the glory of a
cloister.&nbsp; Perhaps none but Archie knew she could be
eloquent; perhaps none but he had seen her—her colour
raised, her hands clasped or quivering—glow with gentle
ardour.&nbsp; There is a corner of the policy of Hermiston, where
you come suddenly in view of the summit of Black Fell, sometimes
like the mere grass top of a hill, sometimes (and this is her own
expression) like a precious jewel in the heavens.&nbsp; On such
days, upon the sudden view of it, her hand would tighten on the
child’s fingers, her voice rise like a song.&nbsp;
“<i>I to the hills</i>!” she would repeat.&nbsp;
“And O, Erchie, are nae these like the hills of
Naphtali?” and her tears would flow.</p>
<p>Upon an impressionable child the effect of this continual and
pretty accompaniment to life was deep.&nbsp; The woman’s
quietism and piety passed on to his different nature
undiminished; but whereas in her it was a native sentiment, in
him it was only an implanted dogma.&nbsp; Nature and the
child’s pugnacity at times revolted.&nbsp; A cad from the
Potterrow once struck him in the mouth; he struck back, the pair
fought it out in the back stable lane towards the Meadows, and
Archie returned with a considerable decline in the number of his
front teeth, and unregenerately boasting of the losses of the
foe.&nbsp; It was a sore day for Mrs. Weir; she wept and prayed
over the infant backslider until my lord was due from Court, and
she must resume that air of tremulous composure with which she
always greeted him.&nbsp; The judge was that day in an observant
mood, and remarked upon the absent teeth.</p>
<p>“I am afraid Erchie will have been fechting with some of
they blagyard lads,” said Mrs. Weir.</p>
<p>My lord’s voice rang out as it did seldom in the privacy
of his own house.&nbsp; “I’ll have norm of that,
sir!” he cried.&nbsp; “Do you hear me?—nonn of
that!&nbsp; No son of mine shall be speldering in the glaur with
any dirty raibble.”</p>
<p>The anxious mother was grateful for so much support; she had
even feared the contrary.&nbsp; And that night when she put the
child to bed—“Now, my dear, ye see!” she said,
“I told you what your faither would think of it, if he
heard ye had fallen into this dreidful sin; and let you and me
pray to God that ye may be keepit from the like temptation or
strengthened to resist it!”</p>
<p>The womanly falsity of this was thrown away.&nbsp; Ice and
iron cannot be welded; and the points of view of the
Justice-Clerk and Mrs. Weir were not less unassimilable.&nbsp;
The character and position of his father had long been a
stumbling-block to Archie, and with every year of his age the
difficulty grew more instant.&nbsp; The man was mostly silent;
when he spoke at all, it was to speak of the things of the world,
always in a worldly spirit, often in language that the child had
been schooled to think coarse, and sometimes with words that he
knew to be sins in themselves.&nbsp; Tenderness was the first
duty, and my lord was invariably harsh.&nbsp; God was love; the
name of my lord (to all who knew him) was fear.&nbsp; In the
world, as schematised for Archie by his mother, the place was
marked for such a creature.&nbsp; There were some whom it was
good to pity and well (though very likely useless) to pray for;
they were named reprobates, goats, God’s enemies, brands
for the burning; and Archie tallied every mark of identification,
and drew the inevitable private inference that the Lord
Justice-Clerk was the chief of sinners.</p>
<p>The mother’s honesty was scarce complete.&nbsp; There
was one influence she feared for the child and still secretly
combated; that was my lord’s; and half unconsciously, half
in a wilful blindness, she continued to undermine her husband
with his son.&nbsp; As long as Archie remained silent, she did so
ruthlessly, with a single eye to heaven and the child’s
salvation; but the day came when Archie spoke.&nbsp; It was 1801,
and Archie was seven, and beyond his years for curiosity and
logic, when he brought the case up openly.&nbsp; If judging were
sinful and forbidden, how came papa to be a judge? to have that
sin for a trade? to bear the name of it for a distinction?</p>
<p>“I can’t see it,” said the little Rabbi, and
wagged his head.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weir abounded in commonplace replies.</p>
<p>“No, I cannae see it,” reiterated Archie.&nbsp;
“And I’ll tell you what, mamma, I don’t think
you and me’s justifeed in staying with him.”</p>
<p>The woman awoke to remorse, she saw herself disloyal to her
man, her sovereign and bread-winner, in whom (with what she had
of worldliness) she took a certain subdued pride.&nbsp; She
expatiated in reply on my lord’s honour and greatness; his
useful services in this world of sorrow and wrong, and the place
in which he stood, far above where babes and innocents could hope
to see or criticise.&nbsp; But she had builded too
well—Archie had his answers pat: Were not babes and
innocents the type of the kingdom of heaven?&nbsp; Were not
honour and greatness the badges of the world?&nbsp; And at any
rate, how about the mob that had once seethed about the
carriage?</p>
<p>“It’s all very fine,” he concluded,
“but in my opinion papa has no right to be it.&nbsp; And it
seems that’s not the worst yet of it.&nbsp; It seems
he’s called “The Hanging judge”—it seems
he’s crooool.&nbsp; I’ll tell you what it is, mamma,
there’s a tex’ borne in upon me: It were better for
that man if a milestone were bound upon his back and him flung
into the deepestmost pairts of the sea.”</p>
<p>“O, my lamb, ye must never say the like of that!”
she cried.&nbsp; “Ye’re to honour faither and mother,
dear, that your days may be long in the land.&nbsp; It’s
Atheists that cry out against him—French Atheists,
Erchie!&nbsp; Ye would never surely even yourself down to be
saying the same thing as French Atheists?&nbsp; It would break my
heart to think that of you.&nbsp; And O, Erchie, here
are’na <i>you</i> setting up to <i>judge</i>?&nbsp; And
have ye no forgot God’s plain command—the First with
Promise, dear?&nbsp; Mind you upon the beam and the
mote!”</p>
<p>Having thus carried the war into the enemy’s camp, the
terrified lady breathed again.&nbsp; And no doubt it is easy thus
to circumvent a child with catchwords, but it may be questioned
how far it is effectual.&nbsp; An instinct in his breast detects
the quibble, and a voice condemns it.&nbsp; He will instantly
submit, privately hold the same opinion.&nbsp; For even in this
simple and antique relation of the mother and the child,
hypocrisies are multiplied.</p>
<p>When the Court rose that year and the family returned to
Hermiston, it was a common remark in all the country that the
lady was sore failed.&nbsp; She seemed to loose and seize again
her touch with life, now sitting inert in a sort of durable
bewilderment, anon waking to feverish and weak activity.&nbsp;
She dawdled about the lasses at their work, looking stupidly on;
she fell to rummaging in old cabinets and presses, and desisted
when half through; she would begin remarks with an air of
animation and drop them without a struggle.&nbsp; Her common
appearance was of one who has forgotten something and is trying
to remember; and when she overhauled, one after another, the
worthless and touching mementoes of her youth, she might have
been seeking the clue to that lost thought.&nbsp; During this
period, she gave many gifts to the neighbours and house lasses,
giving them with a manner of regret that embarrassed the
recipients.</p>
<p>The last night of all she was busy on some female work, and
toiled upon it with so manifest and painful a devotion that my
lord (who was not often curious) inquired as to its nature.</p>
<p>She blushed to the eyes.&nbsp; “O, Edom, it’s for
you!” she said.&nbsp; “It’s slippers. I—I
hae never made ye any.”</p>
<p>“Ye daft auld wife!” returned his lordship.&nbsp;
“A bonny figure I would be, palmering about in
bauchles!”</p>
<p>The next day, at the hour of her walk, Kirstie
interfered.&nbsp; Kirstie took this decay of her mistress very
hard; bore her a grudge, quarrelled with and railed upon her, the
anxiety of a genuine love wearing the disguise of temper.&nbsp;
This day of all days she insisted disrespectfully, with rustic
fury, that Mrs. Weir should stay at home.&nbsp; But, “No,
no,” she said, “it’s my lord’s
orders,” and set forth as usual.&nbsp; Archie was visible
in the acre bog, engaged upon some childish enterprise, the
instrument of which was mire; and she stood and looked at him a
while like one about to call; then thought otherwise, sighed, and
shook her head, and proceeded on her rounds alone.&nbsp; The
house lasses were at the burnside washing, and saw her pass with
her loose, weary, dowdy gait.</p>
<p>“She’s a terrible feckless wife, the
mistress!” said the one.</p>
<p>“Tut,” said the other, “the wumman’s
seeck.”</p>
<p>“Weel, I canna see nae differ in her,” returned
the first.&nbsp; “A fushionless quean, a feckless
carline.”</p>
<p>The poor creature thus discussed rambled a while in the
grounds without a purpose.&nbsp; Tides in her mind ebbed and
flowed, and carried her to and fro like seaweed.&nbsp; She tried
a path, paused, returned, and tried another; questing, forgetting
her quest; the spirit of choice extinct in her bosom, or devoid
of sequency.&nbsp; On a sudden, it appeared as though she had
remembered, or had formed a resolution, wheeled about, returned
with hurried steps, and appeared in the dining-room, where
Kirstie was at the cleaning, like one charged with an important
errand.</p>
<p>“Kirstie!” she began, and paused; and then with
conviction, “Mr. Weir isna speeritually minded, but he has
been a good man to me.”</p>
<p>It was perhaps the first time since her husband’s
elevation that she had forgotten the handle to his name, of which
the tender, inconsistent woman was not a little proud.&nbsp; And
when Kirstie looked up at the speaker’s face, she was aware
of a change.</p>
<p>“Godsake, what’s the maitter wi’ ye,
mem?” cried the housekeeper, starting from the rug.</p>
<p>“I do not ken,” answered her mistress, shaking her
head.&nbsp; “But he is not speeritually minded, my
dear.”</p>
<p>“Here, sit down with ye!&nbsp; Godsake, what ails the
wife?” cried Kirstie, and helped and forced her into my
lord’s own chair by the cheek of the hearth.</p>
<p>“Keep me, what’s this?” she gasped.&nbsp;
“Kirstie, what’s this?&nbsp; I’m
frich’ened.”</p>
<p>They were her last words.</p>
<p>It was the lowering nightfall when my lord returned.&nbsp; He
had the sunset in his back, all clouds and glory; and before him,
by the wayside, spied Kirstie Elliott waiting.&nbsp; She was
dissolved in tears, and addressed him in the high, false note of
barbarous mourning, such as still lingers modified among Scots
heather.</p>
<p>“The Lord peety ye, Hermiston! the Lord prepare
ye!” she keened out.&nbsp; “Weary upon me, that I
should have to tell it!”</p>
<p>He reined in his horse and looked upon her with the hanging
face.</p>
<p>“Has the French landit?” cried he.</p>
<p>“Man, man,” she said, “is that a’ ye
can think of?&nbsp; The Lord prepare ye: the Lord comfort and
support ye!”</p>
<p>“Is onybody deid?” said his lordship.&nbsp;
“It’s no Erchie?”</p>
<p>“Bethankit, no!” exclaimed the woman, startled
into a more natural tone.&nbsp; “Na, na, it’s no sae
bad as that.&nbsp; It’s the mistress, my lord; she just
fair flittit before my e’en.&nbsp; She just gi’ed a
sab and was by wi’ it.&nbsp; Eh, my bonny Miss Jeannie,
that I mind sae weel!”&nbsp; And forth again upon that
pouring tide of lamentation in which women of her class excel and
over-abound.</p>
<p>Lord Hermiston sat in the saddle beholding her.&nbsp; Then he
seemed to recover command upon himself.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s something of the suddenest,”
said he.&nbsp; “But she was a dwaibly body from the
first.”</p>
<p>And he rode home at a precipitate amble with Kirstie at his
horse’s heels.</p>
<p>Dressed as she was for her last walk, they had laid the dead
lady on her bed.&nbsp; She was never interesting in life; in
death she was not impressive; and as her husband stood before
her, with his hands crossed behind his powerful back, that which
he looked upon was the very image of the insignificant.</p>
<p>“Her and me were never cut out for one another,”
he remarked at last.&nbsp; “It was a daft-like
marriage.”&nbsp; And then, with a most unusual gentleness
of tone, “Puir bitch,” said he, “puir
bitch!”&nbsp; Then suddenly: “Where’s
Erchie?”</p>
<p>Kirstie had decoyed him to her room and given him “a
jeely-piece.”</p>
<p>“Ye have some kind of gumption, too,” observed the
judge, and considered his housekeeper grimly.&nbsp; “When
all’s said,” he added, “I micht have done
waur—I micht have been marriet upon a skirting Jezebel like
you!”</p>
<p>“There’s naebody thinking of you,
Hermiston!” cried the offended woman.&nbsp; “We think
of her that’s out of her sorrows.&nbsp; And could
<i>she</i> have done waur?&nbsp; Tell me that,
Hermiston—tell me that before her clay-cauld
corp!”</p>
<p>“Weel, there’s some of them gey an’ ill to
please,” observed his lordship.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II—FATHER AND SON</h2>
<p>My Lord Justice-Clerk was known to many; the man Adam Weir
perhaps to none.&nbsp; He had nothing to explain or to conceal;
he sufficed wholly and silently to himself; and that part of our
nature which goes out (too often with false coin) to acquire
glory or love, seemed in him to be omitted.&nbsp; He did not try
to be loved, he did not care to be; it is probable the very
thought of it was a stranger to his mind.&nbsp; He was an admired
lawyer, a highly unpopular judge; and he looked down upon those
who were his inferiors in either distinction, who were lawyers of
less grasp or judges not so much detested.&nbsp; In all the rest
of his days and doings, not one trace of vanity appeared; and he
went on through life with a mechanical movement, as of the
unconscious; that was almost august.</p>
<p>He saw little of his son.&nbsp; In the childish maladies with
which the boy was troubled, he would make daily inquiries and
daily pay him a visit, entering the sick-room with a facetious
and appalling countenance, letting off a few perfunctory jests,
and going again swiftly, to the patient’s relief.&nbsp;
Once, a court holiday falling opportunely, my lord had his
carriage, and drove the child himself to Hermiston, the customary
place of convalescence.&nbsp; It is conceivable he had been more
than usually anxious, for that journey always remained in
Archie’s memory as a thing apart, his father having related
to him from beginning to end, and with much detail, three
authentic murder cases.&nbsp; Archie went the usual round of
other Edinburgh boys, the high school and the college; and
Hermiston looked on, or rather looked away, with scarce an
affectation of interest in his progress.&nbsp; Daily, indeed,
upon a signal after dinner, he was brought in, given nuts and a
glass of port, regarded sardonically, sarcastically
questioned.&nbsp; “Well, sir, and what have you donn with
your book to-day?” my lord might begin, and set him posers
in law Latin.&nbsp; To a child just stumbling into Corderius,
Papinian and Paul proved quite invincible.&nbsp; But papa had
memory of no other.&nbsp; He was not harsh to the little scholar,
having a vast fund of patience learned upon the bench, and was at
no pains whether to conceal or to express his
disappointment.&nbsp; “Well, ye have a long jaunt before ye
yet!” he might observe, yawning, and fall back on his own
thoughts (as like as not) until the time came for separation, and
my lord would take the decanter and the glass, and be off to the
back chamber looking on the Meadows, where he toiled on his cases
till the hours were small.&nbsp; There was no “fuller
man” on the bench; his memory was marvellous, though wholly
legal; if he had to “advise” extempore, none did it
better; yet there was none who more earnestly prepared.&nbsp; As
he thus watched in the night, or sat at table and forgot the
presence of his son, no doubt but he tasted deeply of recondite
pleasures.&nbsp; To be wholly devoted to some intellectual
exercise is to have succeeded in life; and perhaps only in law
and the higher mathematics may this devotion be maintained,
suffice to itself without reaction, and find continual rewards
without excitement.&nbsp; This atmosphere of his father’s
sterling industry was the best of Archie’s education.&nbsp;
Assuredly it did not attract him; assuredly it rather rebutted
and depressed.&nbsp; Yet it was still present, unobserved like
the ticking of a clock, an arid ideal, a tasteless stimulant in
the boy’s life.</p>
<p>But Hermiston was not all of one piece.&nbsp; He was, besides,
a mighty toper; he could sit at wine until the day dawned, and
pass directly from the table to the bench with a steady hand and
a clear head.&nbsp; Beyond the third bottle, he showed the
plebeian in a larger print; the low, gross accent, the low, foul
mirth, grew broader and commoner; he became less formidable, and
infinitely more disgusting.&nbsp; Now, the boy had inherited from
Jean Rutherford a shivering delicacy, unequally mated with
potential violence.&nbsp; In the playing-fields, and amongst his
own companions, he repaid a coarse expression with a blow; at his
father’s table (when the time came for him to join these
revels) he turned pale and sickened in silence. Of all the guests
whom he there encountered, he had toleration for only one: David
Keith Carnegie, Lord Glenalmond.&nbsp; Lord Glenalmond was tall
and emaciated, with long features and long delicate hands.&nbsp;
He was often compared with the statue of Forbes of Culloden in
the Parliament House; and his blue eye, at more than sixty,
preserved some of the fire of youth.&nbsp; His exquisite
disparity with any of his fellow-guests, his appearance as of an
artist and an aristocrat stranded in rude company, riveted the
boy’s attention; and as curiosity and interest are the
things in the world that are the most immediately and certainly
rewarded, Lord Glenalmond was attracted by the boy.</p>
<p>“And so this is your son, Hermiston?” he asked,
laying his hand on Archie’s shoulder.&nbsp;
“He’s getting a big lad.”</p>
<p>“Hout!” said the gracious father, “just his
mother over again—daurna say boo to a goose!”</p>
<p>But the stranger retained the boy, talked to him, drew him
out, found in him a taste for letters, and a fine, ardent,
modest, youthful soul; and encouraged him to be a visitor on
Sunday evenings in his bare, cold, lonely dining-room, where he
sat and read in the isolation of a bachelor grown old in
refinement.&nbsp; The beautiful gentleness and grace of the old
judge, and the delicacy of his person, thoughts, and language,
spoke to Archie’s heart in its own tongue.&nbsp; He
conceived the ambition to be such another; and, when the day came
for him to choose a profession, it was in emulation of Lord
Glenalmond, not of Lord Hermiston, that he chose the Bar.&nbsp;
Hermiston looked on at this friendship with some secret pride,
but openly with the intolerance of scorn.&nbsp; He scarce lost an
opportunity to put them down with a rough jape; and, to say
truth, it was not difficult, for they were neither of them
quick.&nbsp; He had a word of contempt for the whole crowd of
poets, painters, fiddlers, and their admirers, the bastard race
of amateurs, which was continually on his lips.&nbsp;
“Signor Feedle-eerie!” he would say.&nbsp; “O,
for Goad’s sake, no more of the Signor!”</p>
<p>“You and my father are great friends, are you
not?” asked Archie once.</p>
<p>“There is no man that I more respect, Archie,”
replied Lord Glenalmond.&nbsp; “He is two things of
price.&nbsp; He is a great lawyer, and he is upright as the
day.”</p>
<p>“You and he are so different,” said the boy, his
eyes dwelling on those of his old friend, like a lover’s on
his mistress’s.</p>
<p>“Indeed so,” replied the judge; “very
different.&nbsp; And so I fear are you and he.&nbsp; Yet I would
like it very ill if my young friend were to misjudge his
father.&nbsp; He has all the Roman virtues: Cato and Brutus were
such; I think a son’s heart might well be proud of such an
ancestry of one.”</p>
<p>“And I would sooner he were a plaided herd,” cried
Archie, with sudden bitterness.</p>
<p>“And that is neither very wise, nor I believe entirely
true,” returned Glenalmond.&nbsp; “Before you are
done you will find some of these expressions rise on you like a
remorse.&nbsp; They are merely literary and decorative; they do
not aptly express your thought, nor is your thought clearly
apprehended, and no doubt your father (if he were here) would
say, ‘Signor Feedle-eerie!’”</p>
<p>With the infinitely delicate sense of youth, Archie avoided
the subject from that hour.&nbsp; It was perhaps a pity.&nbsp;
Had he but talked—talked freely—let himself gush out
in words (the way youth loves to do and should), there might have
been no tale to write upon the Weirs of Hermiston.&nbsp; But the
shadow of a threat of ridicule sufficed; in the slight tartness
of these words he read a prohibition; and it is likely that
Glenalmond meant it so.</p>
<p>Besides the veteran, the boy was without confidant or
friend.&nbsp; Serious and eager, he came through school and
college, and moved among a crowd of the indifferent, in the
seclusion of his shyness.&nbsp; He grew up handsome, with an
open, speaking countenance, with graceful, youthful ways; he was
clever, he took prizes, he shone in the Speculative
Society.&nbsp; It should seem he must become the centre of a
crowd of friends; but something that was in part the delicacy of
his mother, in part the austerity of his father, held him aloof
from all.&nbsp; It is a fact, and a strange one, that among his
contemporaries Hermiston’s son was thought to be a chip of
the old block.&nbsp; “You’re a friend of Archie
Weir’s?” said one to Frank Innes; and Innes replied,
with his usual flippancy and more than his usual insight:
“I know Weir, but I never met Archie.”&nbsp; No one
had met Archie, a malady most incident to only sons.&nbsp; He
flew his private signal, and none heeded it; it seemed he was
abroad in a world from which the very hope of intimacy was
banished; and he looked round about him on the concourse of his
fellow-students, and forward to the trivial days and
acquaintances that were to come, without hope or interest.</p>
<p>As time went on, the tough and rough old sinner felt himself
drawn to the son of his loins and sole continuator of his new
family, with softnesses of sentiment that he could hardly credit
and was wholly impotent to express.&nbsp; With a face, voice, and
manner trained through forty years to terrify and repel,
Rhadamanthus may be great, but he will scarce be engaging.&nbsp;
It is a fact that he tried to propitiate Archie, but a fact that
cannot be too lightly taken; the attempt was so unconspicuously
made, the failure so stoically supported.&nbsp; Sympathy is not
due to these steadfast iron natures.&nbsp; If he failed to gain
his son’s friendship, or even his son’s toleration,
on he went up the great, bare staircase of his duty, uncheered
and undepressed.&nbsp; There might have been more pleasure in his
relations with Archie, so much he may have recognised at moments;
but pleasure was a by-product of the singular chemistry of life,
which only fools expected.</p>
<p>An idea of Archie’s attitude, since we are all grown up
and have forgotten the days of our youth, it is more difficult to
convey.&nbsp; He made no attempt whatsoever to understand the man
with whom he dined and breakfasted.&nbsp; Parsimony of pain, glut
of pleasure, these are the two alternating ends of youth; and
Archie was of the parsimonious.&nbsp; The wind blew cold out of a
certain quarter—he turned his back upon it; stayed as
little as was possible in his father’s presence; and when
there, averted his eyes as much as was decent from his
father’s face.&nbsp; The lamp shone for many hundred days
upon these two at table—my lord, ruddy, gloomy, and
unreverent; Archie with a potential brightness that was always
dimmed and veiled in that society; and there were not, perhaps,
in Christendom two men more radically strangers.&nbsp; The
father, with a grand simplicity, either spoke of what interested
himself, or maintained an unaffected silence.&nbsp; The son
turned in his head for some topic that should be quite safe, that
would spare him fresh evidences either of my lord’s
inherent grossness or of the innocence of his inhumanity;
treading gingerly the ways of intercourse, like a lady gathering
up her skirts in a by-path.&nbsp; If he made a mistake, and my
lord began to abound in matter of offence, Archie drew himself
up, his brow grew dark, his share of the talk expired; but my
lord would faithfully and cheerfully continue to pour out the
worst of himself before his silent and offended son.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s a poor hert that never
rejoices!” he would say, at the conclusion of such a
nightmare interview.&nbsp; “But I must get to my
plew-stilts.” And he would seclude himself as usual in his
back room, and Archie go forth into the night and the city
quivering with animosity and scorn.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III—IN THE MATTER OF THE HANGING OF DUNCAN
JOPP</h2>
<p>It chanced in the year 1813 that Archie strayed one day into
the Justiciary Court.&nbsp; The macer made room for the son of
the presiding judge.&nbsp; In the dock, the centre of men’s
eyes, there stood a whey-coloured, misbegotten caitiff, Duncan
Jopp, on trial for his life.&nbsp; His story, as it was raked out
before him in that public scene, was one of disgrace and vice and
cowardice, the very nakedness of crime; and the creature heard
and it seemed at times as though he understood—as if at
times he forgot the horror of the place he stood in, and
remembered the shame of what had brought him there.&nbsp; He kept
his head bowed and his hands clutched upon the rail; his hair
dropped in his eyes and at times he flung it back; and now he
glanced about the audience in a sudden fellness of terror, and
now looked in the face of his judge and gulped.&nbsp; There was
pinned about his throat a piece of dingy flannel; and this it was
perhaps that turned the scale in Archie’s mind between
disgust and pity.&nbsp; The creature stood in a vanishing point;
yet a little while, and he was still a man, and had eyes and
apprehension; yet a little longer, and with a last sordid piece
of pageantry, he would cease to be.&nbsp; And here, in the
meantime, with a trait of human nature that caught at the
beholder’s breath, he was tending a sore throat.</p>
<p>Over against him, my Lord Hermiston occupied the bench in the
red robes of criminal jurisdiction, his face framed in the white
wig.&nbsp; Honest all through, he did not affect the virtue of
impartiality; this was no case for refinement; there was a man to
be hanged, he would have said, and he was hanging him.&nbsp; Nor
was it possible to see his lordship, and acquit him of gusto in
the task.&nbsp; It was plain he gloried in the exercise of his
trained faculties, in the clear sight which pierced at once into
the joint of fact, in the rude, unvarnished gibes with which he
demolished every figment of defence.&nbsp; He took his ease and
jested, unbending in that solemn place with some of the freedom
of the tavern; and the rag of man with the flannel round his neck
was hunted gallowsward with jeers.</p>
<p>Duncan had a mistress, scarce less forlorn and greatly older
than himself, who came up, whimpering and curtseying, to add the
weight of her betrayal.&nbsp; My lord gave her the oath in his
most roaring voice, and added an intolerant warning.</p>
<p>“Mind what ye say now, Janet,” said he.&nbsp;
“I have an e’e upon ye, I’m ill to jest
with.”</p>
<p>Presently, after she was tremblingly embarked on her story,
“And what made ye do this, ye auld runt?” the Court
interposed.&nbsp; “Do ye mean to tell me ye was the
panel’s mistress?”</p>
<p>“If you please, ma loard,” whined the female.</p>
<p>“Godsake! ye made a bonny couple,” observed his
lordship; and there was something so formidable and ferocious in
his scorn that not even the galleries thought to laugh.</p>
<p>The summing up contained some jewels.</p>
<p>“These two peetiable creatures seem to have made up
thegither, it’s not for us to explain
why.”—“The panel, who (whatever else he may be)
appears to be equally ill set-out in mind and
boady.”—“Neither the panel nor yet the old wife
appears to have had so much common sense as even to tell a lie
when it was necessary.”&nbsp; And in the course of
sentencing, my lord had this <i>obiter dictum</i>: “I have
been the means, under God, of haanging a great number, but never
just such a disjaskit rascal as yourself.”&nbsp; The words
were strong in themselves; the light and heat and detonation of
their delivery, and the savage pleasure of the speaker in his
task, made them tingle in the ears.</p>
<p>When all was over, Archie came forth again into a changed
world.&nbsp; Had there been the least redeeming greatness in the
crime, any obscurity, any dubiety, perhaps he might have
understood.&nbsp; But the culprit stood, with his sore throat, in
the sweat of his mortal agony, without defence or excuse: a thing
to cover up with blushes: a being so much sunk beneath the zones
of sympathy that pity might seem harmless.&nbsp; And the judge
had pursued him with a monstrous, relishing gaiety, horrible to
be conceived, a trait for nightmares.&nbsp; It is one thing to
spear a tiger, another to crush a toad; there are æsthetics
even of the slaughter-house; and the loathsomeness of Duncan Jopp
enveloped and infected the image of his judge.</p>
<p>Archie passed by his friends in the High Street with
incoherent words and gestures.&nbsp; He saw Holyrood in a dream,
remembrance of its romance awoke in him and faded; he had a
vision of the old radiant stories, of Queen Mary and Prince
Charlie, of the hooded stag, of the splendour and crime, the
velvet and bright iron of the past; and dismissed them with a cry
of pain.&nbsp; He lay and moaned in the Hunter’s Bog, and
the heavens were dark above him and the grass of the field an
offence.&nbsp; “This is my father,” he said.&nbsp;
“I draw my life from him; the flesh upon my bones is his,
the bread I am fed with is the wages of these
horrors.”&nbsp; He recalled his mother, and ground his
forehead in the earth.&nbsp; He thought of flight, and where was
he to flee to? of other lives, but was there any life worth
living in this den of savage and jeering animals?</p>
<p>The interval before the execution was like a violent
dream.&nbsp; He met his father; he would not look at him, he
could not speak to him.&nbsp; It seemed there was no living
creature but must have been swift to recognise that imminent
animosity; but the hide of the Justice-Clerk remained
impenetrable.&nbsp; Had my lord been talkative, the truce could
never have subsisted; but he was by fortune in one of his humours
of sour silence; and under the very guns of his broadside, Archie
nursed the enthusiasm of rebellion.&nbsp; It seemed to him, from
the top of his nineteen years’ experience, as if he were
marked at birth to be the perpetrator of some signal action, to
set back fallen Mercy, to overthrow the usurping devil that sat,
horned and hoofed, on her throne.&nbsp; Seductive Jacobin
figments, which he had often refuted at the Speculative, swam up
in his mind and startled him as with voices: and he seemed to
himself to walk accompanied by an almost tangible presence of new
beliefs and duties.</p>
<p>On the named morning he was at the place of execution.&nbsp;
He saw the fleering rabble, the flinching wretch produced.&nbsp;
He looked on for a while at a certain parody of devotion, which
seemed to strip the wretch of his last claim to manhood.&nbsp;
Then followed the brutal instant of extinction, and the paltry
dangling of the remains like a broken jumping-jack.&nbsp; He had
been prepared for something terrible, not for this tragic
meanness.&nbsp; He stood a moment silent, and then—“I
denounce this God-defying murder,” he shouted; and his
father, if he must have disclaimed the sentiment, might have
owned the stentorian voice with which it was uttered.</p>
<p>Frank Innes dragged him from the spot.&nbsp; The two handsome
lads followed the same course of study and recreation, and felt a
certain mutual attraction, founded mainly on good looks.&nbsp; It
had never gone deep; Frank was by nature a thin, jeering
creature, not truly susceptible whether of feeling or inspiring
friendship; and the relation between the pair was altogether on
the outside, a thing of common knowledge and the pleasantries
that spring from a common acquaintance.&nbsp; The more credit to
Frank that he was appalled by Archie’s outburst, and at
least conceived the design of keeping him in sight, and, if
possible, in hand, for the day.&nbsp; But Archie, who had just
defied—was it God or Satan?—would not listen to the
word of a college companion.</p>
<p>“I will not go with you,” he said.&nbsp; “I
do not desire your company, sir; I would be alone.”</p>
<p>“Here, Weir, man, don’t be absurd,” said
Innes, keeping a tight hold upon his sleeve.&nbsp; “I will
not let you go until I know what you mean to do with yourself;
it’s no use brandishing that staff.”&nbsp; For indeed
at that moment Archie had made a sudden—perhaps a
warlike—movement.&nbsp; “This has been the most
insane affair; you know it has.&nbsp; You know very well that
I’m playing the good Samaritan.&nbsp; All I wish is to keep
you quiet.”</p>
<p>“If quietness is what you wish, Mr. Innes,” said
Archie, “and you will promise to leave me entirely to
myself, I will tell you so much, that I am going to walk in the
country and admire the beauties of nature.”</p>
<p>“Honour bright?” asked Frank.</p>
<p>“I am not in the habit of lying, Mr. Innes,”
retorted Archie.&nbsp; “I have the honour of wishing you
good-day.”</p>
<p>“You won’t forget the Spec.?” asked
Innes.</p>
<p>“The Spec.?” said Archie.&nbsp; “O no, I
won’t forget the Spec.”</p>
<p>And the one young man carried his tortured spirit forth of the
city and all the day long, by one road and another, in an endless
pilgrimage of misery; while the other hastened smilingly to
spread the news of Weir’s access of insanity, and to drum
up for that night a full attendance at the Speculative, where
further eccentric developments might certainly be looked
for.&nbsp; I doubt if Innes had the least belief in his
prediction; I think it flowed rather from a wish to make the
story as good and the scandal as great as possible; not from any
ill-will to Archie—from the mere pleasure of beholding
interested faces.&nbsp; But for all that his words were
prophetic.&nbsp; Archie did not forget the Spec.; he put in an
appearance there at the due time, and, before the evening was
over, had dealt a memorable shock to his companions.&nbsp; It
chanced he was the president of the night.&nbsp; He sat in the
same room where the Society still meets—only the portraits
were not there: the men who afterwards sat for them were then but
beginning their career.&nbsp; The same lustre of many tapers shed
its light over the meeting; the same chair, perhaps, supported
him that so many of us have sat in since.&nbsp; At times he
seemed to forget the business of the evening, but even in these
periods he sat with a great air of energy and
determination.&nbsp; At times he meddled bitterly, and launched
with defiance those fines which are the precious and rarely used
artillery of the president.&nbsp; He little thought, as he did
so, how he resembled his father, but his friends remarked upon
it, chuckling.&nbsp; So far, in his high place above his
fellow-students, he seemed set beyond the possibility of any
scandal; but his mind was made up—he was determined to
fulfil the sphere of his offence.&nbsp; He signed to Innes (whom
he had just fined, and who just impeached his ruling) to succeed
him in the chair, stepped down from the platform, and took his
place by the chimney-piece, the shine of many wax tapers from
above illuminating his pale face, the glow of the great red fire
relieving from behind his slim figure.&nbsp; He had to propose,
as an amendment to the next subject in the case-book,
“Whether capital punishment be consistent with God’s
will or man’s policy?”</p>
<p>A breath of embarrassment, of something like alarm, passed
round the room, so daring did these words appear upon the lips of
Hermiston’s only son.&nbsp; But the amendment was not
seconded; the previous question was promptly moved and
unanimously voted, and the momentary scandal smuggled by.&nbsp;
Innes triumphed in the fulfilment of his prophecy.&nbsp; He and
Archie were now become the heroes of the night; but whereas every
one crowded about Innes, when the meeting broke up, but one of
all his companions came to speak to Archie.</p>
<p>“Weir, man!&nbsp; That was an extraordinary raid of
yours!” observed this courageous member, taking him
confidentially by the arm as they went out.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it a raid,” said Archie
grimly.&nbsp; “More like a war.&nbsp; I saw that poor brute
hanged this morning, and my gorge rises at it yet.”</p>
<p>“Hut-tut,” returned his companion, and, dropping
his arm like something hot, he sought the less tense society of
others.</p>
<p>Archie found himself alone.&nbsp; The last of the
faithful—or was it only the boldest of the
curious?—had fled.&nbsp; He watched the black huddle of his
fellow-students draw off down and up the street, in whispering or
boisterous gangs.&nbsp; And the isolation of the moment weighed
upon him like an omen and an emblem of his destiny in life.&nbsp;
Bred up in unbroken fear himself, among trembling servants, and
in a house which (at the least ruffle in the master’s
voice) shuddered into silence, he saw himself on the brink of the
red valley of war, and measured the danger and length of it with
awe.&nbsp; He made a detour in the glimmer and shadow of the
streets, came into the back stable lane, and watched for a long
while the light burn steady in the Judge’s room.&nbsp; The
longer he gazed upon that illuminated window-blind, the more
blank became the picture of the man who sat behind it, endlessly
turning over sheets of process, pausing to sip a glass of port,
or rising and passing heavily about his book-lined walls to
verify some reference.&nbsp; He could not combine the brutal
judge and the industrious, dispassionate student; the connecting
link escaped him; from such a dual nature, it was impossible he
should predict behaviour; and he asked himself if he had done
well to plunge into a business of which the end could not be
foreseen? and presently after, with a sickening decline of
confidence, if he had done loyally to strike his father?&nbsp;
For he had struck him—defied him twice over and before a
cloud of witnesses—struck him a public buffet before
crowds.&nbsp; Who had called him to judge his father in these
precarious and high questions?&nbsp; The office was
usurped.&nbsp; It might have become a stranger; in a
son—there was no blinking it—in a son, it was
disloyal.&nbsp; And now, between these two natures so
antipathetic, so hateful to each other, there was depending an
unpardonable affront: and the providence of God alone might
foresee the manner in which it would be resented by Lord
Hermiston.</p>
<p>These misgivings tortured him all night and arose with him in
the winter’s morning; they followed him from class to
class, they made him shrinkingly sensitive to every shade of
manner in his companions, they sounded in his ears through the
current voice of the professor; and he brought them home with him
at night unabated and indeed increased.&nbsp; The cause of this
increase lay in a chance encounter with the celebrated Dr.
Gregory.&nbsp; Archie stood looking vaguely in the lighted window
of a book shop, trying to nerve himself for the approaching
ordeal.&nbsp; My lord and he had met and parted in the morning as
they had now done for long, with scarcely the ordinary civilities
of life; and it was plain to the son that nothing had yet reached
the father’s ears.&nbsp; Indeed, when he recalled the awful
countenance of my lord, a timid hope sprang up in him that
perhaps there would be found no one bold enough to carry
tales.&nbsp; If this were so, he asked himself, would he begin
again? and he found no answer.&nbsp; It was at this moment that a
hand was laid upon his arm, and a voice said in his ear,
“My dear Mr. Archie, you had better come and see
me.”</p>
<p>He started, turned round, and found himself face to face with
Dr. Gregory.&nbsp; “And why should I come to see
you?” he asked, with the defiance of the miserable.</p>
<p>“Because you are looking exceedingly ill,” said
the doctor, “and you very evidently want looking after, my
young friend.&nbsp; Good folk are scarce, you know; and it is not
every one that would be quite so much missed as yourself.&nbsp;
It is not every one that Hermiston would miss.”</p>
<p>And with a nod and a smile, the doctor passed on.</p>
<p>A moment after, Archie was in pursuit, and had in turn, but
more roughly, seized him by the arm.</p>
<p>“What do you mean? what did you mean by saying
that?&nbsp; What makes you think that Hermis—my father
would have missed me?”</p>
<p>The doctor turned about and looked him all over with a
clinical eye.&nbsp; A far more stupid man than Dr. Gregory might
have guessed the truth; but ninety-nine out of a hundred, even if
they had been equally inclined to kindness, would have blundered
by some touch of charitable exaggeration.&nbsp; The doctor was
better inspired.&nbsp; He knew the father well; in that white
face of intelligence and suffering, he divined something of the
son; and he told, without apology or adornment, the plain
truth.</p>
<p>“When you had the measles, Mr. Archibald, you had them
gey and ill; and I thought you were going to slip between my
fingers,” he said.&nbsp; “Well, your father was
anxious.&nbsp; How did I know it? says you.&nbsp; Simply because
I am a trained observer.&nbsp; The sign that I saw him make, ten
thousand would have missed; and perhaps—<i>perhaps</i>, I
say, because he’s a hard man to judge of—but perhaps
he never made another.&nbsp; A strange thing to consider!&nbsp;
It was this.&nbsp; One day I came to him:
‘Hermiston,’ said I, ‘there’s a
change.’&nbsp; He never said a word, just glowered at me
(if ye’ll pardon the phrase) like a wild beast.&nbsp;
‘A change for the better,’ said I.&nbsp; And I
distinctly heard him take his breath.”</p>
<p>The doctor left no opportunity for anti-climax; nodding his
cocked hat (a piece of antiquity to which he clung) and repeating
“Distinctly” with raised eye-brows, he took his
departure, and left Archie speechless in the street.</p>
<p>The anecdote might be called infinitely little, and yet its
meaning for Archie was immense.&nbsp; “I did not know the
old man had so much blood in him.”&nbsp; He had never
dreamed this sire of his, this aboriginal antique, this
adamantine Adam, had even so much of a heart as to be moved in
the least degree for another—and that other himself, who
had insulted him! With the generosity of youth, Archie was
instantly under arms upon the other side: had instantly created a
new image of Lord Hermiston, that of a man who was all iron
without and all sensibility within.&nbsp; The mind of the vile
jester, the tongue that had pursued Duncan Jopp with unmanly
insults, the unbeloved countenance that he had known and feared
for so long, were all forgotten; and he hastened home, impatient
to confess his misdeeds, impatient to throw himself on the mercy
of this imaginary character.</p>
<p>He was not to be long without a rude awakening.&nbsp; It was
in the gloaming when he drew near the door-step of the lighted
house, and was aware of the figure of his father approaching from
the opposite side.&nbsp; Little daylight lingered; but on the
door being opened, the strong yellow shine of the lamp gushed out
upon the landing and shone full on Archie, as he stood, in the
old-fashioned observance of respect, to yield precedence.&nbsp;
The judge came without haste, stepping stately and firm; his chin
raised, his face (as he entered the lamplight) strongly
illumined, his mouth set hard.&nbsp; There was never a wink of
change in his expression; without looking to the right or left,
he mounted the stair, passed close to Archie, and entered the
house.&nbsp; Instinctively, the boy, upon his first coming, had
made a movement to meet him; instinctively he recoiled against
the railing, as the old man swept by him in a pomp of
indignation.&nbsp; Words were needless; he knew all—perhaps
more than all—and the hour of judgment was at hand.</p>
<p>It is possible that, in this sudden revulsion of hope, and
before these symptoms of impending danger, Archie might have
fled.&nbsp; But not even that was left to him.&nbsp; My lord,
after hanging up his cloak and hat, turned round in the lighted
entry, and made him an imperative and silent gesture with his
thumb, and with the strange instinct of obedience, Archie
followed him into the house.</p>
<p>All dinner-time there reigned over the Judge’s table a
palpable silence, and as soon as the solids were despatched he
rose to his feet.</p>
<p>“M‘Killup, tak’ the wine into my
room,” said he; and then to his son: “Archie, you and
me has to have a talk.”</p>
<p>It was at this sickening moment that Archie’s courage,
for the first and last time, entirely deserted him.&nbsp;
“I have an appointment,” said he.</p>
<p>“It’ll have to be broken, then,” said
Hermiston, and led the way into his study.</p>
<p>The lamp was shaded, the fire trimmed to a nicety, the table
covered deep with orderly documents, the backs of law books made
a frame upon all sides that was only broken by the window and the
doors.</p>
<p>For a moment Hermiston warmed his hands at the fire,
presenting his back to Archie; then suddenly disclosed on him the
terrors of the Hanging Face.</p>
<p>“What’s this I hear of ye?” he asked.</p>
<p>There was no answer possible to Archie.</p>
<p>“I’ll have to tell ye, then,” pursued
Hermiston.&nbsp; “It seems ye’ve been skirting
against the father that begot ye, and one of his Maijesty’s
Judges in this land; and that in the public street, and while an
order of the Court was being executit.&nbsp; Forbye which, it
would appear that ye’ve been airing your opeenions in a
Coallege Debatin’ Society”; he paused a moment: and
then, with extraordinary bitterness, added: “Ye damned
eediot.”</p>
<p>“I had meant to tell you,” stammered Archie.&nbsp;
“I see you are well informed.”</p>
<p>“Muckle obleeged to ye,” said his lordship, and
took his usual seat.&nbsp; “And so you disapprove of
Caapital Punishment?” he added.</p>
<p>“I am sorry, sir, I do,” said Archie.</p>
<p>“I am sorry, too,” said his lordship.&nbsp;
“And now, if you please, we shall approach this business
with a little more parteecularity.&nbsp; I hear that at the
hanging of Duncan Jopp—and, man! ye had a fine client
there—in the middle of all the riff-raff of the ceety, ye
thought fit to cry out, ‘This is a damned murder, and my
gorge rises at the man that haangit him.’”</p>
<p>“No, sir, these were not my words,” cried
Archie.</p>
<p>“What were yer words, then?” asked the Judge.</p>
<p>“I believe I said, ‘I denounce it as a
murder!’” said the son.&nbsp; “I beg your
pardon—a God-defying murder.&nbsp; I have no wish to
conceal the truth,” he added, and looked his father for a
moment in the face.</p>
<p>“God, it would only need that of it next!” cried
Hermiston.&nbsp; “There was nothing about your gorge
rising, then?”</p>
<p>“That was afterwards, my lord, as I was leaving the
Speculative.&nbsp; I said I had been to see the miserable
creature hanged, and my gorge rose at it.”</p>
<p>“Did ye, though?” said Hermiston.&nbsp; “And
I suppose ye knew who haangit him?”</p>
<p>“I was present at the trial, I ought to tell you that, I
ought to explain.&nbsp; I ask your pardon beforehand for any
expression that may seem undutiful.&nbsp; The position in which I
stand is wretched,” said the unhappy hero, now fairly face
to face with the business he had chosen.&nbsp; “I have been
reading some of your cases.&nbsp; I was present while Jopp was
tried.&nbsp; It was a hideous business.&nbsp; Father, it was a
hideous thing!&nbsp; Grant he was vile, why should you hunt him
with a vileness equal to his own?&nbsp; It was done with
glee—that is the word—you did it with glee; and I
looked on, God help me! with horror.”</p>
<p>“You’re a young gentleman that doesna approve of
Caapital Punishment,” said Hermiston.&nbsp; “Weel,
I’m an auld man that does.&nbsp; I was glad to get Jopp
haangit, and what for would I pretend I wasna?&nbsp; You’re
all for honesty, it seems; you couldn’t even steik your
mouth on the public street.&nbsp; What for should I steik mines
upon the bench, the King’s officer, bearing the sword, a
dreid to evil-doers, as I was from the beginning, and as I will
be to the end!&nbsp; Mair than enough of it! Heedious!&nbsp; I
never gave twa thoughts to heediousness, I have no call to be
bonny.&nbsp; I’m a man that gets through with my
day’s business, and let that suffice.”</p>
<p>The ring of sarcasm had died out of his voice as he went on;
the plain words became invested with some of the dignity of the
Justice-seat.</p>
<p>“It would be telling you if you could say as
much,” the speaker resumed.&nbsp; “But ye
cannot.&nbsp; Ye’ve been reading some of my cases, ye
say.&nbsp; But it was not for the law in them, it was to spy out
your faither’s nakedness, a fine employment in a son.&nbsp;
You’re splairging; you’re running at lairge in life
like a wild nowt.&nbsp; It’s impossible you should think
any longer of coming to the Bar.&nbsp; You’re not fit for
it; no splairger is.&nbsp; And another thing: son of mines or no
son of mines, you have flung fylement in public on one of the
Senators of the Coallege of Justice, and I would make it my
business to see that ye were never admitted there yourself.&nbsp;
There is a kind of a decency to be observit.&nbsp; Then comes the
next of it—what am I to do with ye next?&nbsp; Ye’ll
have to find some kind of a trade, for I’ll never support
ye in idleset.&nbsp; What do ye fancy ye’ll be fit
for?&nbsp; The pulpit?&nbsp; Na, they could never get diveenity
into that bloackhead.&nbsp; Him that the law of man whammles is
no likely to do muckle better by the law of God.&nbsp; What would
ye make of hell?&nbsp; Wouldna your gorge rise at that?&nbsp; Na,
there’s no room for splairgers under the fower quarters of
John Calvin.&nbsp; What else is there?&nbsp; Speak up.&nbsp; Have
ye got nothing of your own?”</p>
<p>“Father, let me go to the Peninsula,” said
Archie.&nbsp; “That’s all I’m fit for—to
fight.”</p>
<p>“All? quo’ he!” returned the Judge.&nbsp;
“And it would be enough too, if I thought it.&nbsp; But
I’ll never trust ye so near the French, you that’s so
Frenchi-feed.”</p>
<p>“You do me injustice there, sir,” said
Archie.&nbsp; “I am loyal; I will not boast; but any
interest I may have ever felt in the French—”</p>
<p>“Have ye been so loyal to me?” interrupted his
father.</p>
<p>There came no reply.</p>
<p>“I think not,” continued Hermiston.&nbsp;
“And I would send no man to be a servant to the King, God
bless him! that has proved such a shauchling son to his own
faither.&nbsp; You can splairge here on Edinburgh street, and
where’s the hairm?&nbsp; It doesna play buff on me!&nbsp;
And if there were twenty thousand eediots like yourself, sorrow a
Duncan Jopp would hang the fewer.&nbsp; But there’s no
splairging possible in a camp; and if ye were to go to it, you
would find out for yourself whether Lord Well’n’ton
approves of caapital punishment or not.&nbsp; You a
sodger!” he cried, with a sudden burst of scorn.&nbsp;
“Ye auld wife, the sodgers would bray at ye like
cuddies!”</p>
<p>As at the drawing of a curtain, Archie was aware of some
illogicality in his position, and stood abashed.&nbsp; He had a
strong impression, besides, of the essential valour of the old
gentleman before him, how conveyed it would be hard to say.</p>
<p>“Well, have ye no other proposeetion?” said my
lord again.</p>
<p>“You have taken this so calmly, sir, that I cannot but
stand ashamed,” began Archie.</p>
<p>“I’m nearer voamiting, though, than you would
fancy,” said my lord.&nbsp; The blood rose to
Archie’s brow.</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon, I should have said that you had
accepted my affront. . . . I admit it was an affront; I did not
think to apologise, but I do, I ask your pardon; it will not be
so again, I pass you my word of honour. . . . I should have said
that I admired your magnanimity
with—this—offender,” Archie concluded with a
gulp.</p>
<p>“I have no other son, ye see,” said
Hermiston.&nbsp; “A bonny one I have gotten!&nbsp; But I
must just do the best I can wi’ him, and what am I to do?
If ye had been younger, I would have wheepit ye for this
rideeculous exhibeetion.&nbsp; The way it is, I have just to grin
and bear.&nbsp; But one thing is to be clearly understood.&nbsp;
As a faither, I must grin and bear it; but if I had been the Lord
Advocate instead of the Lord Justice-Clerk, son or no son, Mr.
Erchibald Weir would have been in a jyle the night.”</p>
<p>Archie was now dominated.&nbsp; Lord Hermiston was coarse and
cruel; and yet the son was aware of a bloomless nobility, an
ungracious abnegation of the man’s self in the man’s
office.&nbsp; At every word, this sense of the greatness of Lord
Hermiston’s spirit struck more home; and along with it that
of his own impotence, who had struck—and perhaps basely
struck—at his own father, and not reached so far as to have
even nettled him.</p>
<p>“I place myself in your hands without reserve,” he
said.</p>
<p>“That’s the first sensible word I’ve had of
ye the night,” said Hermiston.&nbsp; “I can tell ye,
that would have been the end of it, the one way or the other; but
it’s better ye should come there yourself, than what I
would have had to hirstle ye.&nbsp; Weel, by my way of
it—and my way is the best—there’s just the one
thing it’s possible that ye might be with decency, and
that’s a laird.&nbsp; Ye’ll be out of hairm’s
way at the least of it.&nbsp; If ye have to rowt, ye can rowt
amang the kye; and the maist feck of the caapital punishment
ye’re like to come across’ll be guddling
trouts.&nbsp; Now, I’m for no idle lairdies; every man has
to work, if it’s only at peddling ballants; to work, or to
be wheeped, or to be haangit.&nbsp; If I set ye down at Hermiston
I’ll have to see you work that place the way it has never
been workit yet; ye must ken about the sheep like a herd; ye must
be my grieve there, and I’ll see that I gain by ye.&nbsp;
Is that understood?”</p>
<p>“I will do my best,” said Archie.</p>
<p>“Well, then, I’ll send Kirstie word the morn, and
ye can go yourself the day after,” said Hermiston.&nbsp;
“And just try to be less of an eediot!” he concluded
with a freezing smile, and turned immediately to the papers on
his desk.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV—OPINIONS OF THE BENCH</h2>
<p>Late the same night, after a disordered walk, Archie was
admitted into Lord Glenalmond’s dining-room, where he sat
with a book upon his knee, beside three frugal coals of
fire.&nbsp; In his robes upon the bench, Glenalmond had a certain
air of burliness: plucked of these, it was a may-pole of a man
that rose unsteadily from his chair to give his visitor
welcome.&nbsp; Archie had suffered much in the last days, he had
suffered again that evening; his face was white and drawn, his
eyes wild and dark.&nbsp; But Lord Glenalmond greeted him without
the least mark of surprise or curiosity.</p>
<p>“Come in, come in,” said he.&nbsp; “Come in
and take a seat.&nbsp; Carstairs” (to his servant),
“make up the fire, and then you can bring a bit of
supper,” and again to Archie, with a very trivial accent:
“I was half expecting you,” he added.</p>
<p>“No supper,” said Archie.&nbsp; “It is
impossible that I should eat.”</p>
<p>“Not impossible,” said the tall old man, laying
his hand upon his shoulder, “and, if you will believe me,
necessary.”</p>
<p>“You know what brings me?” said Archie, as soon as
the servant had left the room.</p>
<p>“I have a guess, I have a guess,” replied
Glenalmond.&nbsp; “We will talk of it presently—when
Carstairs has come and gone, and you have had a piece of my good
Cheddar cheese and a pull at the porter tankard: not
before.”</p>
<p>“It is impossible I should eat” repeated
Archie.</p>
<p>“Tut, tut!” said Lord Glenalmond.&nbsp; “You
have eaten nothing to-day, and I venture to add, nothing
yesterday.&nbsp; There is no case that may not be made worse;
this may be a very disagreeable business, but if you were to fall
sick and die, it would be still more so, and for all
concerned—for all concerned.”</p>
<p>“I see you must know all,” said Archie.&nbsp;
“Where did you hear it?”</p>
<p>“In the mart of scandal, in the Parliament House,”
said Glenalmond.&nbsp; “It runs riot below among the bar
and the public, but it sifts up to us upon the bench, and rumour
has some of her voices even in the divisions.”</p>
<p>Carstairs returned at this moment, and rapidly laid out a
little supper; during which Lord Glenalmond spoke at large and a
little vaguely on indifferent subjects, so that it might be
rather said of him that he made a cheerful noise, than that he
contributed to human conversation; and Archie sat upon the other
side, not heeding him, brooding over his wrongs and errors.</p>
<p>But so soon as the servant was gone, he broke forth again at
once.&nbsp; “Who told my father?&nbsp; Who dared to tell
him?&nbsp; Could it have been you?”</p>
<p>“No, it was not me,” said the Judge;
“although—to be quite frank with you, and after I had
seen and warned you—it might have been me—I believe
it was Glenkindie.”</p>
<p>“That shrimp!” cried Archie.</p>
<p>“As you say, that shrimp,” returned my lord;
“although really it is scarce a fitting mode of expression
for one of the senators of the College of Justice.&nbsp; We were
hearing the parties in a long, crucial case, before the fifteen;
Creech was moving at some length for an infeftment; when I saw
Glenkindie lean forward to Hermiston with his hand over his mouth
and make him a secret communication.&nbsp; No one could have
guessed its nature from your father: from Glenkindie, yes, his
malice sparked out of him a little grossly.&nbsp; But your
father, no.&nbsp; A man of granite.&nbsp; The next moment he
pounced upon Creech.&nbsp; ‘Mr. Creech,’ says he,
‘I’ll take a look of that sasine,’ and for
thirty minutes after,” said Glenalmond, with a smile,
“Messrs. Creech and Co. were fighting a pretty up-hill
battle, which resulted, I need hardly add, in their total
rout.&nbsp; The case was dismissed.&nbsp; No, I doubt if ever I
heard Hermiston better inspired.&nbsp; He was literally rejoicing
<i>in apicibus juris</i>.”</p>
<p>Archie was able to endure no longer.&nbsp; He thrust his plate
away and interrupted the deliberate and insignificant stream of
talk.&nbsp; “Here,” he said, “I have made a
fool of myself, if I have not made something worse.&nbsp; Do you
judge between us—judge between a father and a son.&nbsp; I
can speak to you; it is not like . . . I will tell you what I
feel and what I mean to do; and you shall be the judge,” he
repeated.</p>
<p>“I decline jurisdiction,” said Glenalmond, with
extreme seriousness.&nbsp; “But, my dear boy, if it will do
you any good to talk, and if it will interest you at all to hear
what I may choose to say when I have heard you, I am quite at
your command.&nbsp; Let an old man say it, for once, and not need
to blush: I love you like a son.”</p>
<p>There came a sudden sharp sound in Archie’s
throat.&nbsp; “Ay,” he cried, “and there it
is!&nbsp; Love!&nbsp; Like a son!&nbsp; And how do you think I
love my father?”</p>
<p>“Quietly, quietly,” says my lord.</p>
<p>“I will be very quiet,” replied Archie.&nbsp;
“And I will be baldly frank.&nbsp; I do not love my father;
I wonder sometimes if I do not hate him.&nbsp; There’s my
shame; perhaps my sin; at least, and in the sight of God, not my
fault.&nbsp; How was I to love him?&nbsp; He has never spoken to
me, never smiled upon me; I do not think he ever touched
me.&nbsp; You know the way he talks? You do not talk so, yet you
can sit and hear him without shuddering, and I cannot.&nbsp; My
soul is sick when he begins with it; I could smite him in the
mouth.&nbsp; And all that’s nothing.&nbsp; I was at the
trial of this Jopp.&nbsp; You were not there, but you must have
heard him often; the man’s notorious for it, for
being—look at my position! he’s my father and this is
how I have to speak of him—notorious for being a brute and
cruel and a coward.&nbsp; Lord Glenalmond, I give you my word,
when I came out of that Court, I longed to die—the shame of
it was beyond my strength: but I—I—” he rose
from his seat and began to pace the room in a disorder.&nbsp;
“Well, who am I?&nbsp; A boy, who have never been tried,
have never done anything except this twopenny impotent folly with
my father.&nbsp; But I tell you, my lord, and I know myself, I am
at least that kind of a man—or that kind of a boy, if you
prefer it—that I could die in torments rather than that any
one should suffer as that scoundrel suffered.&nbsp; Well, and
what have I done?&nbsp; I see it now.&nbsp; I have made a fool of
myself, as I said in the beginning; and I have gone back, and
asked my father’s pardon, and placed myself wholly in his
hands—and he has sent me to Hermiston,” with a
wretched smile, “for life, I suppose—and what can I
say? he strikes me as having done quite right, and let me off
better than I had deserved.”</p>
<p>“My poor, dear boy!” observed Glenalmond.&nbsp;
“My poor dear and, if you will allow me to say so, very
foolish boy!&nbsp; You are only discovering where you are; to one
of your temperament, or of mine, a painful discovery.&nbsp; The
world was not made for us; it was made for ten hundred millions
of men, all different from each other and from us; there’s
no royal road there, we just have to sclamber and tumble.&nbsp;
Don’t think that I am at all disposed to be surprised;
don’t suppose that I ever think of blaming you; indeed I
rather admire!&nbsp; But there fall to be offered one or two
observations on the case which occur to me and which (if you will
listen to them dispassionately) may be the means of inducing you
to view the matter more calmly.&nbsp; First of all, I cannot
acquit you of a good deal of what is called intolerance.&nbsp;
You seem to have been very much offended because your father
talks a little sculduddery after dinner, which it is perfectly
licit for him to do, and which (although I am not very fond of it
myself) appears to be entirely an affair of taste.&nbsp; Your
father, I scarcely like to remind you, since it is so trite a
commonplace, is older than yourself.&nbsp; At least, he is
<i>major</i> and <i>sui juris</i>, and may please himself in the
matter of his conversation.&nbsp; And, do you know, I wonder if
he might not have as good an answer against you and me?&nbsp; We
say we sometimes find him <i>coarse</i>, but I suspect he might
retort that he finds us always dull.&nbsp; Perhaps a relevant
exception.”</p>
<p>He beamed on Archie, but no smile could be elicited.</p>
<p>“And now,” proceeded the Judge, “for
‘Archibald on Capital Punishment.’&nbsp; This is a
very plausible academic opinion; of course I do not and I cannot
hold it; but that’s not to say that many able and excellent
persons have not done so in the past.&nbsp; Possibly, in the past
also, I may have a little dipped myself in the same heresy.&nbsp;
My third client, or possibly my fourth, was the means of a return
in my opinions.&nbsp; I never saw the man I more believed in; I
would have put my hand in the fire, I would have gone to the
cross for him; and when it came to trial he was gradually
pictured before me, by undeniable probation, in the light of so
gross, so cold-blooded, and so black-hearted a villain, that I
had a mind to have cast my brief upon the table.&nbsp; I was then
boiling against the man with even a more tropical temperature
than I had been boiling for him.&nbsp; But I said to myself:
‘No, you have taken up his case; and because you have
changed your mind it must not be suffered to let drop.&nbsp; All
that rich tide of eloquence that you prepared last night with so
much enthusiasm is out of place, and yet you must not desert him,
you must say something.’&nbsp; So I said something, and I
got him off.&nbsp; It made my reputation.&nbsp; But an experience
of that kind is formative.&nbsp; A man must not bring his
passions to the bar—or to the bench,” he added.</p>
<p>The story had slightly rekindled Archie’s
interest.&nbsp; “I could never deny,” he
began—“I mean I can conceive that some men would be
better dead.&nbsp; But who are we to know all the springs of
God’s unfortunate creatures?&nbsp; Who are we to trust
ourselves where it seems that God Himself must think twice before
He treads, and to do it with delight? Yes, with delight.&nbsp;
<i>Tigris ut aspera</i>.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps not a pleasant spectacle,” said
Glenalmond.&nbsp; “And yet, do you know, I think somehow a
great one.”</p>
<p>“I’ve had a long talk with him to-night,”
said Archie.</p>
<p>“I was supposing so,” said Glenalmond.</p>
<p>“And he struck me—I cannot deny that he struck me
as something very big,” pursued the son.&nbsp; “Yes,
he is big.&nbsp; He never spoke about himself; only about
me.&nbsp; I suppose I admired him.&nbsp; The dreadful
part—”</p>
<p>“Suppose we did not talk about that,” interrupted
Glenalmond.&nbsp; “You know it very well, it cannot in any
way help that you should brood upon it, and I sometimes wonder
whether you and I—who are a pair of
sentimentalists—are quite good judges of plain
men.”</p>
<p>“How do you mean?” asked Archie.</p>
<p>“<i>Fair</i> judges, mean,” replied
Glenalmond.&nbsp; “Can we be just to them?&nbsp; Do we not
ask too much?&nbsp; There was a word of yours just now that
impressed me a little when you asked me who we were to know all
the springs of God’s unfortunate creatures.&nbsp; You
applied that, as I understood, to capital cases only.&nbsp; But
does it—I ask myself—does it not apply all
through?&nbsp; Is it any less difficult to judge of a good man or
of a half-good man, than of the worst criminal at the bar?&nbsp;
And may not each have relevant excuses?”</p>
<p>“Ah, but we do not talk of punishing the good,”
cried Archie.</p>
<p>“No, we do not talk of it,” said Glenalmond.&nbsp;
“But I think we do it.&nbsp; Your father, for
instance.”</p>
<p>“You think I have punished him?” cried Archie.</p>
<p>Lord Glenalmond bowed his head.</p>
<p>“I think I have,” said Archie.&nbsp; “And
the worst is, I think he feels it! How much, who can tell, with
such a being?&nbsp; But I think he does.”</p>
<p>“And I am sure of it,” said Glenalmond.</p>
<p>“Has he spoken to you, then?” cried Archie.</p>
<p>“O no,” replied the judge.</p>
<p>“I tell you honestly,” said Archie, “I want
to make it up to him.&nbsp; I will go, I have already pledged
myself to go to Hermiston.&nbsp; That was to him.&nbsp; And now I
pledge myself to you, in the sight of God, that I will close my
mouth on capital punishment and all other subjects where our
views may clash, for—how long shall I say? when shall I
have sense enough?—ten years.&nbsp; Is that
well?”</p>
<p>“It is well,” said my lord.</p>
<p>“As far as it goes,” said Archie.&nbsp; “It
is enough as regards myself, it is to lay down enough of my
conceit.&nbsp; But as regards him, whom I have publicly
insulted?&nbsp; What am I to do to him?&nbsp; How do you pay
attentions to a—an Alp like that?”</p>
<p>“Only in one way,” replied Glenalmond.&nbsp;
“Only by obedience, punctual, prompt, and
scrupulous.”</p>
<p>“And I promise that he shall have it,” answered
Archie.&nbsp; “I offer you my hand in pledge of
it.”</p>
<p>“And I take your hand as a solemnity,” replied the
judge.&nbsp; “God bless you, my dear, and enable you to
keep your promise.&nbsp; God guide you in the true way, and spare
your days, and preserve to you your honest heart.” At that,
he kissed the young man upon the forehead in a gracious, distant,
antiquated way; and instantly launched, with a marked change of
voice, into another subject.&nbsp; “And now, let us
replenish the tankard; and I believe if you will try my Cheddar
again, you would find you had a better appetite.&nbsp; The Court
has spoken, and the case is dismissed.”</p>
<p>“No, there is one thing I must say,” cried
Archie.&nbsp; “I must say it in justice to himself.&nbsp; I
know—I believe faithfully, slavishly, after our
talk—he will never ask me anything unjust.&nbsp; I am proud
to feel it, that we have that much in common, I am proud to say
it to you.”</p>
<p>The Judge, with shining eyes, raised his tankard.&nbsp;
“And I think perhaps that we might permit ourselves a
toast,” said he.&nbsp; “I should like to propose the
health of a man very different from me and very much my
superior—a man from whom I have often differed, who has
often (in the trivial expression) rubbed me the wrong way, but
whom I have never ceased to respect and, I may add, to be not a
little afraid of.&nbsp; Shall I give you his name?”</p>
<p>“The Lord Justice-Clerk, Lord Hermiston,” said
Archie, almost with gaiety; and the pair drank the toast
deeply.</p>
<p>It was not precisely easy to re-establish, after these
emotional passages, the natural flow of conversation.&nbsp; But
the Judge eked out what was wanting with kind looks, produced his
snuff-box (which was very rarely seen) to fill in a pause, and at
last, despairing of any further social success, was upon the
point of getting down a book to read a favourite passage, when
there came a rather startling summons at the front door, and
Carstairs ushered in my Lord Glenkindie, hot from a midnight
supper.&nbsp; I am not aware that Glenkindie was ever a beautiful
object, being short, and gross-bodied, and with an expression of
sensuality comparable to a bear’s.&nbsp; At that moment,
coming in hissing from many potations, with a flushed countenance
and blurred eyes, he was strikingly contrasted with the tall,
pale, kingly figure of Glenalmond.&nbsp; A rush of confused
thought came over Archie—of shame that this was one of his
father’s elect friends; of pride, that at the least of it
Hermiston could carry his liquor; and last of all, of rage, that
he should have here under his eyes the man that had betrayed
him.&nbsp; And then that too passed away; and he sat quiet,
biding his opportunity.</p>
<p>The tipsy senator plunged at once into an explanation with
Glenalmond.&nbsp; There was a point reserved yesterday, he had
been able to make neither head nor tail of it, and seeing lights
in the house, he had just dropped in for a glass of
porter—and at this point he became aware of the third
person.&nbsp; Archie saw the cod’s mouth and the blunt lips
of Glenkindie gape at him for a moment, and the recognition
twinkle in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Who’s this?” said he.&nbsp; “What? is
this possibly you, Don Quickshot?&nbsp; And how are ye?&nbsp; And
how’s your father?&nbsp; And what’s all this we hear
of you? It seems you’re a most extraordinary leveller, by
all tales.&nbsp; No king, no parliaments, and your gorge rises at
the macers, worthy men!&nbsp; Hoot, toot!&nbsp; Dear, dear
me!&nbsp; Your father’s son too!&nbsp; Most
rideeculous!”</p>
<p>Archie was on his feet, flushing a little at the reappearance
of his unhappy figure of speech, but perfectly
self-possessed.&nbsp; “My lord—and you, Lord
Glenalmond, my dear friend,” he began, “this is a
happy chance for me, that I can make my confession and offer my
apologies to two of you at once.”</p>
<p>“Ah, but I don’t know about that.&nbsp;
Confession?&nbsp; It’ll be judeecial, my young
friend,” cried the jocular Glenkindie.&nbsp; “And
I’m afraid to listen to ye.&nbsp; Think if ye were to make
me a coanvert!”</p>
<p>“If you would allow me, my lord,” returned Archie,
“what I have to say is very serious to me; and be pleased
to be humorous after I am gone!”</p>
<p>“Remember, I’ll hear nothing against the
macers!” put in the incorrigible Glenkindie.</p>
<p>But Archie continued as though he had not spoken.&nbsp;
“I have played, both yesterday and to-day, a part for which
I can only offer the excuse of youth.&nbsp; I was so unwise as to
go to an execution; it seems I made a scene at the gallows; not
content with which, I spoke the same night in a college society
against capital punishment.&nbsp; This is the extent of what I
have done, and in case you hear more alleged against me, I
protest my innocence.&nbsp; I have expressed my regret already to
my father, who is so good as to pass my conduct over—in a
degree, and upon the condition that I am to leave my law
studies.” . . .</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V—WINTER ON THE MOORS</h2>
<h3>I. At Hermiston</h3>
<p>The road to Hermiston runs for a great part of the way up the
valley of a stream, a favourite with anglers and with midges,
full of falls and pools, and shaded by willows and natural woods
of birch.&nbsp; Here and there, but at great distances, a byway
branches off, and a gaunt farmhouse may be descried above in a
fold of the hill; but the more part of the time, the road would
be quite empty of passage and the hills of habitation.&nbsp;
Hermiston parish is one of the least populous in Scotland; and,
by the time you came that length, you would scarce be surprised
at the inimitable smallness of the kirk, a dwarfish, ancient
place seated for fifty, and standing in a green by the burn-side
among two-score gravestones.&nbsp; The manse close by, although
no more than a cottage, is surrounded by the brightness of a
flower-garden and the straw roofs of bees; and the whole colony,
kirk and manse, garden and graveyard, finds harbourage in a grove
of rowans, and is all the year round in a great silence broken
only by the drone of the bees, the tinkle of the burn, and the
bell on Sundays.&nbsp; A mile beyond the kirk the road leaves the
valley by a precipitous ascent, and brings you a little after to
the place of Hermiston, where it comes to an end in the back-yard
before the coach-house.&nbsp; All beyond and about is the great
field, of the hills; the plover, the curlew, and the lark cry
there; the wind blows as it blows in a ship’s rigging, hard
and cold and pure; and the hill-tops huddle one behind another
like a herd of cattle into the sunset.</p>
<p>The house was sixty years old, unsightly, comfortable; a
farmyard and a kitchen-garden on the left, with a fruit wall
where little hard green pears came to their maturity about the
end of October.</p>
<p>The policy (as who should say the park) was of some extent,
but very ill reclaimed; heather and moorfowl had crossed the
boundary wall and spread and roosted within; and it would have
tasked a landscape gardener to say where policy ended and
unpolicied nature began.&nbsp; My lord had been led by the
influence of Mr. Sheriff Scott into a considerable design of
planting; many acres were accordingly set out with fir, and the
little feathery besoms gave a false scale and lent a strange air
of a toy-shop to the moors.&nbsp; A great, rooty sweetness of
bogs was in the air, and at all seasons an infinite melancholy
piping of hill birds.&nbsp; Standing so high and with so little
shelter, it was a cold, exposed house, splashed by showers,
drenched by continuous rains that made the gutters to spout,
beaten upon and buffeted by all the winds of heaven; and the
prospect would be often black with tempest, and often white with
the snows of winter.&nbsp; But the house was wind and weather
proof, the hearths were kept bright, and the rooms pleasant with
live fires of peat; and Archie might sit of an evening and hear
the squalls bugle on the moorland, and watch the fire prosper in
the earthy fuel, and the smoke winding up the chimney, and drink
deep of the pleasures of shelter.</p>
<p>Solitary as the place was, Archie did not want
neighbours.&nbsp; Every night, if he chose, he might go down to
the manse and share a “brewst” of toddy with the
minister—a hare-brained ancient gentleman, long and light
and still active, though his knees were loosened with age, and
his voice broke continually in childish trebles—and his
lady wife, a heavy, comely dame, without a word to say for
herself beyond good-even and good-day.&nbsp; Harum-scarum,
clodpole young lairds of the neighbourhood paid him the
compliment of a visit.&nbsp; Young Hay of Romanes rode down to
call, on his crop-eared pony; young Pringle of Drumanno came up
on his bony grey.&nbsp; Hay remained on the hospitable field, and
must be carried to bed; Pringle got somehow to his saddle about 3
A.M., and (as Archie stood with the lamp on the upper doorstep)
lurched, uttered a senseless view-holloa, and vanished out of the
small circle of illumination like a wraith.&nbsp; Yet a minute or
two longer the clatter of his break-neck flight was audible, then
it was cut off by the intervening steepness of the hill; and
again, a great while after, the renewed beating of phantom
horse-hoofs, far in the valley of the Hermiston, showed that the
horse at least, if not his rider, was still on the homeward
way.</p>
<p>There was a Tuesday club at the “Cross-keys” in
Crossmichael, where the young bloods of the country-side
congregated and drank deep on a percentage of the expense, so
that he was left gainer who should have drunk the most.&nbsp;
Archie had no great mind to this diversion, but he took it like a
duty laid upon him, went with a decent regularity, did his
manfullest with the liquor, held up his head in the local jests,
and got home again and was able to put up his horse, to the
admiration of Kirstie and the lass that helped her.&nbsp; He
dined at Driffel, supped at Windielaws.&nbsp; He went to the new
year’s ball at Huntsfield and was made welcome, and
thereafter rode to hounds with my Lord Muirfell, upon whose name,
as that of a legitimate Lord of Parliament, in a work so full of
Lords of Session, my pen should pause reverently.&nbsp; Yet the
same fate attended him here as in Edinburgh.&nbsp; The habit of
solitude tends to perpetuate itself, and an austerity of which he
was quite unconscious, and a pride which seemed arrogance, and
perhaps was chiefly shyness, discouraged and offended his new
companions.&nbsp; Hay did not return more than twice, Pringle
never at all, and there came a time when Archie even desisted
from the Tuesday Club, and became in all things—what he had
had the name of almost from the first—the Recluse of
Hermiston.&nbsp; High-nosed Miss Pringle of Drumanno and
high-stepping Miss Marshall of the Mains were understood to have
had a difference of opinion about him the day after the
ball—he was none the wiser, he could not suppose himself to
be remarked by these entrancing ladies.&nbsp; At the ball itself
my Lord Muirfell’s daughter, the Lady Flora, spoke to him
twice, and the second time with a touch of appeal, so that her
colour rose and her voice trembled a little in his ear, like a
passing grace in music.&nbsp; He stepped back with a heart on
fire, coldly and not ungracefully excused himself, and a little
after watched her dancing with young Drumanno of the empty laugh,
and was harrowed at the sight, and raged to himself that this was
a world in which it was given to Drumanno to please, and to
himself only to stand aside and envy.&nbsp; He seemed excluded,
as of right, from the favour of such society—seemed to
extinguish mirth wherever he came, and was quick to feel the
wound, and desist, and retire into solitude.&nbsp; If he had but
understood the figure he presented, and the impression he made on
these bright eyes and tender hearts; if he had but guessed that
the Recluse of Hermiston, young, graceful, well spoken, but
always cold, stirred the maidens of the county with the charm of
Byronism when Byronism was new, it may be questioned whether his
destiny might not even yet have been modified.&nbsp; It may be
questioned, and I think it should be doubted.&nbsp; It was in his
horoscope to be parsimonious of pain to himself, or of the chance
of pain, even to the avoidance of any opportunity of pleasure; to
have a Roman sense of duty, an instinctive aristocracy of manners
and taste; to be the son of Adam Weir and Jean Rutherford.</p>
<h3>2. Kirstie</h3>
<p>Kirstie was now over fifty, and might have sat to a
sculptor.&nbsp; Long of limb, and still light of foot,
deep-breasted, robust-loined, her golden hair not yet mingled
with any trace of silver, the years had but caressed and
embellished her.&nbsp; By the lines of a rich and vigorous
maternity, she seemed destined to be the bride of heroes and the
mother of their children; and behold, by the iniquity of fate,
she had passed through her youth alone, and drew near to the
confines of age, a childless woman.&nbsp; The tender ambitions
that she had received at birth had been, by time and
disappointment, diverted into a certain barren zeal of industry
and fury of interference.&nbsp; She carried her thwarted ardours
into housework, she washed floors with her empty heart.&nbsp; If
she could not win the love of one with love, she must dominate
all by her temper.&nbsp; Hasty, wordy, and wrathful, she had a
drawn quarrel with most of her neighbours, and with the others
not much more than armed neutrality.&nbsp; The grieve’s
wife had been “sneisty”; the sister of the gardener
who kept house for him had shown herself “upsitten”;
and she wrote to Lord Hermiston about once a year demanding the
discharge of the offenders, and justifying the demand by much
wealth of detail.&nbsp; For it must not be supposed that the
quarrel rested with the wife and did not take in the husband
also—or with the gardener’s sister, and did not
speedily include the gardener himself.&nbsp; As the upshot of all
this petty quarrelling and intemperate speech, she was
practically excluded (like a lightkeeper on his tower) from the
comforts of human association; except with her own indoor drudge,
who, being but a lassie and entirely at her mercy, must submit to
the shifty weather of “the mistress’s” moods
without complaint, and be willing to take buffets or caresses
according to the temper of the hour.&nbsp; To Kirstie, thus
situate and in the Indian summer of her heart, which was slow to
submit to age, the gods sent this equivocal good thing of
Archie’s presence.&nbsp; She had known him in the cradle
and paddled him when he misbehaved; and yet, as she had not so
much as set eyes on him since he was eleven and had his last
serious illness, the tall, slender, refined, and rather
melancholy young gentleman of twenty came upon her with the shock
of a new acquaintance.&nbsp; He was “Young
Hermiston,” “the laird himsel’”: he had
an air of distinctive superiority, a cold straight glance of his
black eyes, that abashed the woman’s tantrums in the
beginning, and therefore the possibility of any quarrel was
excluded.&nbsp; He was new, and therefore immediately aroused her
curiosity; he was reticent, and kept it awake.&nbsp; And lastly
he was dark and she fair, and he was male and she female, the
everlasting fountains of interest.</p>
<p>Her feeling partook of the loyalty of a clanswoman, the
hero-worship of a maiden aunt, and the idolatry due to a
god.&nbsp; No matter what he had asked of her, ridiculous or
tragic, she would have done it and joyed to do it.&nbsp; Her
passion, for it was nothing less, entirely filled her.&nbsp; It
was a rich physical pleasure to make his bed or light his lamp
for him when he was absent, to pull off his wet boots or wait on
him at dinner when he returned.&nbsp; A young man who should have
so doted on the idea, moral and physical, of any woman, might be
properly described as being in love, head and heels, and would
have behaved himself accordingly.&nbsp; But Kirstie—though
her heart leaped at his coming footsteps—though, when he
patted her shoulder, her face brightened for the day—had
not a hope or thought beyond the present moment and its
perpetuation to the end of time.&nbsp; Till the end of time she
would have had nothing altered, but still continue delightedly to
serve her idol, and be repaid (say twice in the month) with a
clap on the shoulder.</p>
<p>I have said her heart leaped—it is the accepted
phrase.&nbsp; But rather, when she was alone in any chamber of
the house, and heard his foot passing on the corridors, something
in her bosom rose slowly until her breath was suspended, and as
slowly fell again with a deep sigh, when the steps had passed and
she was disappointed of her eyes’ desire.&nbsp; This
perpetual hunger and thirst of his presence kept her all day on
the alert.&nbsp; When he went forth at morning, she would stand
and follow him with admiring looks.&nbsp; As it grew late and
drew to the time of his return, she would steal forth to a corner
of the policy wall and be seen standing there sometimes by the
hour together, gazing with shaded eyes, waiting the exquisite and
barren pleasure of his view a mile off on the mountains.&nbsp;
When at night she had trimmed and gathered the fire, turned down
his bed, and laid out his night-gear—when there was no more
to be done for the king’s pleasure, but to remember him
fervently in her usually very tepid prayers, and go to bed
brooding upon his perfections, his future career, and what she
should give him the next day for dinner—there still
remained before her one more opportunity; she was still to take
in the tray and say good-night.&nbsp; Sometimes Archie would
glance up from his book with a preoccupied nod and a perfunctory
salutation which was in truth a dismissal; sometimes—and by
degrees more often—the volume would be laid aside, he would
meet her coming with a look of relief; and the conversation would
be engaged, last out the supper, and be prolonged till the small
hours by the waning fire.&nbsp; It was no wonder that Archie was
fond of company after his solitary days; and Kirstie, upon her
side, exerted all the arts of her vigorous nature to ensnare his
attention.&nbsp; She would keep back some piece of news during
dinner to be fired off with the entrance of the supper tray, and
form as it were the <i>lever de rideau</i> of the evening’s
entertainment.&nbsp; Once he had heard her tongue wag, she made
sure of the result.&nbsp; From one subject to another she moved
by insidious transitions, fearing the least silence, fearing
almost to give him time for an answer lest it should slip into a
hint of separation.&nbsp; Like so many people of her class, she
was a brave narrator; her place was on the hearth-rug and she
made it a rostrum, mimeing her stories as she told them, fitting
them with vital detail, spinning them out with endless
“quo’ he’s” and “quo’
she’s,” her voice sinking into a whisper over the
supernatural or the horrific; until she would suddenly spring up
in affected surprise, and pointing to the clock, “Mercy,
Mr. Archie!” she would say, “whatten a time o’
night is this of it!&nbsp; God forgive me for a daft
wife!”&nbsp; So it befell, by good management, that she was
not only the first to begin these nocturnal conversations, but
invariably the first to break them off; so she managed to retire
and not to be dismissed.</p>
<h3>3. A Border Family</h3>
<p>Such an unequal intimacy has never been uncommon in Scotland,
where the clan spirit survives; where the servant tends to spend
her life in the same service, a helpmeet at first, then a tyrant,
and at last a pensioner; where, besides, she is not necessarily
destitute of the pride of birth, but is, perhaps, like Kirstie, a
connection of her master’s, and at least knows the legend
of her own family, and may count kinship with some illustrious
dead.&nbsp; For that is the mark of the Scot of all classes: that
he stands in an attitude towards the past unthinkable to
Englishmen, and remembers and cherishes the memory of his
forebears, good or bad; and there burns alive in him a sense of
identity with the dead even to the twentieth generation.&nbsp; No
more characteristic instance could be found than in the family of
Kirstie Elliott.&nbsp; They were all, and Kirstie the first of
all, ready and eager to pour forth the particulars of their
genealogy, embellished with every detail that memory had handed
down or fancy fabricated; and, behold! from every ramification of
that tree there dangled a halter.&nbsp; The Elliotts themselves
have had a chequered history; but these Elliotts deduced,
besides, from three of the most unfortunate of the border
clans—the Nicksons, the Ellwalds, and the Crozers.&nbsp;
One ancestor after another might be seen appearing a moment out
of the rain and the hill mist upon his furtive business, speeding
home, perhaps, with a paltry booty of lame horses and lean kine,
or squealing and dealing death in some moorland feud of the
ferrets and the wild cats.&nbsp; One after another closed his
obscure adventures in mid-air, triced up to the arm of the royal
gibbet or the Baron’s dule-tree.&nbsp; For the rusty
blunderbuss of Scots criminal justice, which usually hurt nobody
but jurymen, became a weapon of precision for the Nicksons, the
Ellwalds, and the Crozers.&nbsp; The exhilaration of their
exploits seemed to haunt the memories of their descendants alone,
and the shame to be forgotten.&nbsp; Pride glowed in their bosoms
to publish their relationship to “Andrew Ellwald of the
Laverockstanes, called ‘Unchancy Dand,’ who was
justifeed wi’ seeven mair of the same name at Jeddart in
the days of King James the Sax.”&nbsp; In all this tissue
of crime and misfortune, the Elliotts of Cauldstaneslap had one
boast which must appear legitimate: the males were gallows-birds,
born outlaws, petty thieves, and deadly brawlers; but, according
to the same tradition, the females were all chaste and
faithful.&nbsp; The power of ancestry on the character is not
limited to the inheritance of cells.&nbsp; If I buy ancestors by
the gross from the benevolence of Lyon King of Arms, my grandson
(if he is Scottish) will feel a quickening emulation of their
deeds.&nbsp; The men of the Elliotts were proud, lawless, violent
as of right, cherishing and prolonging a tradition.&nbsp; In like
manner with the women.&nbsp; And the woman, essentially
passionate and reckless, who crouched on the rug, in the shine of
the peat fire, telling these tales, had cherished through life a
wild integrity of virtue.</p>
<p>Her father Gilbert had been deeply pious, a savage
disciplinarian in the antique style, and withal a notorious
smuggler.&nbsp; “I mind when I was a bairn getting mony a
skelp and being shoo’d to bed like pou’try,”
she would say.&nbsp; “That would be when the lads and their
bit kegs were on the road.&nbsp; We’ve had the riffraff of
two-three counties in our kitchen, mony’s the time,
betwix’ the twelve and the three; and their lanterns would
be standing in the forecourt, ay, a score o’ them at
once.&nbsp; But there was nae ungodly talk permitted at
Cauldstaneslap.&nbsp; My faither was a consistent man in walk and
conversation; just let slip an aith, and there was the door to
ye!&nbsp; He had that zeal for the Lord, it was a fair wonder to
hear him pray, but the family has aye had a gift that way.”
This father was twice married, once to a dark woman of the old
Ellwald stock, by whom he had Gilbert, presently of
Cauldstaneslap; and, secondly, to the mother of Kirstie.&nbsp;
“He was an auld man when he married her, a fell auld man
wi’ a muckle voice—you could hear him rowting from
the top o’ the Kye-skairs,” she said; “but for
her, it appears she was a perfit wonder.&nbsp; It was gentle
blood she had, Mr. Archie, for it was your ain.&nbsp; The
country-side gaed gyte about her and her gowden hair.&nbsp; Mines
is no to be mentioned wi’ it, and there’s few weemen
has mair hair than what I have, or yet a bonnier colour.&nbsp;
Often would I tell my dear Miss Jeannie—that was your
mother, dear, she was cruel ta’en up about her hair, it was
unco’ tender, ye see—‘Houts, Miss
Jeannie,’ I would say, ‘just fling your washes and
your French dentifrishes in the back o’ the fire, for
that’s the place for them; and awa’ down to a burn
side, and wash yersel’ in cauld hill water, and dry your
bonny hair in the caller wind o’ the muirs, the way that my
mother aye washed hers, and that I have aye made it a practice to
have wishen mines—just you do what I tell ye, my dear, and
ye’ll give me news of it!&nbsp; Ye’ll have hair, and
routh of hair, a pigtail as thick’s my arm,’ I said,
‘and the bonniest colour like the clear gowden guineas, so
as the lads in kirk’ll no can keep their eyes off
it!’&nbsp; Weel, it lasted out her time, puir thing!&nbsp;
I cuttit a lock of it upon her corp that was lying there sae
cauld.&nbsp; I’ll show it ye some of thir days if
ye’re good.&nbsp; But, as I was sayin’, my
mither—”</p>
<p>On the death of the father there remained golden-haired
Kirstie, who took service with her distant kinsfolk, the
Rutherfords, and black-a-vised Gilbert, twenty years older, who
farmed the Cauldstaneslap, married, and begot four sons between
1773 and 1784, and a daughter, like a postscript, in ’97,
the year of Camperdown and Cape St. Vincent.&nbsp; It seemed it
was a tradition in the family to wind up with a belated
girl.&nbsp; In 1804, at the age of sixty, Gilbert met an end that
might be called heroic.&nbsp; He was due home from market any
time from eight at night till five in the morning, and in any
condition from the quarrelsome to the speechless, for he
maintained to that age the goodly customs of the Scots
farmer.&nbsp; It was known on this occasion that he had a good
bit of money to bring home; the word had gone round
loosely.&nbsp; The laird had shown his guineas, and if anybody
had but noticed it, there was an ill-looking, vagabond crew, the
scum of Edinburgh, that drew out of the market long ere it was
dusk and took the hill-road by Hermiston, where it was not to be
believed that they had lawful business.&nbsp; One of the
country-side, one Dickieson, they took with them to be their
guide, and dear he paid for it!&nbsp; Of a sudden in the ford of
the Broken Dykes, this vermin clan fell on the laird, six to one,
and him three parts asleep, having drunk hard.&nbsp; But it is
ill to catch an Elliott.&nbsp; For a while, in the night and the
black water that was deep as to his saddle-girths, he wrought
with his staff like a smith at his stithy, and great was the
sound of oaths and blows.&nbsp; With that the ambuscade was
burst, and he rode for home with a pistol-ball in him, three
knife wounds, the loss of his front teeth, a broken rib and
bridle, and a dying horse.&nbsp; That was a race with death that
the laird rode!&nbsp; In the mirk night, with his broken bridle
and his head swimming, he dug his spurs to the rowels in the
horse’s side, and the horse, that was even worse off than
himself, the poor creature! screamed out loud like a person as he
went, so that the hills echoed with it, and the folks at
Cauldstaneslap got to their feet about the table and looked at
each other with white faces.&nbsp; The horse fell dead at the
yard gate, the laird won the length of the house and fell there
on the threshold.&nbsp; To the son that raised him he gave the
bag of money.&nbsp; “Hae,” said he.&nbsp; All the way
up the thieves had seemed to him to be at his heels, but now the
hallucination left him—he saw them again in the place of
the ambuscade—and the thirst of vengeance seized on his
dying mind.&nbsp; Raising himself and pointing with an imperious
finger into the black night from which he had come, he uttered
the single command, “Brocken Dykes,” and
fainted.&nbsp; He had never been loved, but he had been feared in
honour.&nbsp; At that sight, at that word, gasped out at them
from a toothless and bleeding mouth, the old Elliott spirit awoke
with a shout in the four sons.&nbsp; “Wanting the
hat,” continues my author, Kirstie, whom I but haltingly
follow, for she told this tale like one inspired, “wanting
guns, for there wasna twa grains o’ pouder in the house,
wi’ nae mair weepons than their sticks into their hands,
the fower o’ them took the road.&nbsp; Only Hob, and that
was the eldest, hunkered at the doorsill where the blood had rin,
fyled his hand wi’ it—and haddit it up to Heeven in
the way o’ the auld Border aith.&nbsp; ‘Hell shall
have her ain again this nicht!’ he raired, and rode forth
upon his earrand.”&nbsp; It was three miles to Broken
Dykes, down hill, and a sore road.&nbsp; Kirstie has seen men
from Edinburgh dismounting there in plain day to lead their
horses.&nbsp; But the four brothers rode it as if Auld Hornie
were behind and Heaven in front.&nbsp; Come to the ford, and
there was Dickieson.&nbsp; By all tales, he was not dead, but
breathed and reared upon his elbow, and cried out to them for
help.&nbsp; It was at a graceless face that he asked mercy.&nbsp;
As soon as Hob saw, by the glint of the lantern, the eyes shining
and the whiteness of the teeth in the man’s face,
“Damn you!” says he; “ye hae your teeth, hae
ye?” and rode his horse to and fro upon that human
remnant.&nbsp; Beyond that, Dandie must dismount with the lantern
to be their guide; he was the youngest son, scarce twenty at the
time.&nbsp; “A’ nicht long they gaed in the wet heath
and jennipers, and whaur they gaed they neither knew nor cared,
but just followed the bluid stains and the footprints o’
their faither’s murderers.&nbsp; And a’ nicht Dandie
had his nose to the grund like a tyke, and the ithers followed
and spak’ naething, neither black nor white.&nbsp; There
was nae noise to be heard, but just the sough of the swalled
burns, and Hob, the dour yin, risping his teeth as he
gaed.” With the first glint of the morning they saw they
were on the drove road, and at that the four stopped and had a
dram to their breakfasts, for they knew that Dand must have
guided them right, and the rogues could be but little ahead, hot
foot for Edinburgh by the way of the Pentland Hills.&nbsp; By
eight o’clock they had word of them—a shepherd had
seen four men “uncoly mishandled” go by in the last
hour.&nbsp; “That’s yin a piece,” says Clem,
and swung his cudgel.&nbsp; “Five o’ them!”
says Hob.&nbsp; “God’s death, but the faither was a
man!&nbsp; And him drunk!”&nbsp; And then there befell them
what my author termed “a sair misbegowk,” for they
were overtaken by a posse of mounted neighbours come to aid in
the pursuit.&nbsp; Four sour faces looked on the
reinforcement.&nbsp; “The Deil’s broughten
you!” said Clem, and they rode thenceforward in the rear of
the party with hanging heads.&nbsp; Before ten they had found and
secured the rogues, and by three of the afternoon, as they rode
up the Vennel with their prisoners, they were aware of a
concourse of people bearing in their midst something that
dripped.&nbsp; “For the boady of the saxt,” pursued
Kirstie, “wi’ his head smashed like a hazelnit, had
been a’ that nicht in the chairge o’ Hermiston Water,
and it dunting it on the stanes, and grunding it on the shallows,
and flinging the deid thing heels-ower-hurdie at the Fa’s
o’ Spango; and in the first o’ the day, Tweed had got
a hold o’ him and carried him off like a wind, for it was
uncoly swalled, and raced wi’ him, bobbing under
brae-sides, and was long playing with the creature in the drumlie
lynns under the castle, and at the hinder end of all cuist him up
on the starling of Crossmichael brig.&nbsp; Sae there they were
a’thegither at last (for Dickieson had been brought in on a
cart long syne), and folk could see what mainner o’man my
brither had been that had held his head again sax and saved the
siller, and him drunk!”&nbsp; Thus died of honourable
injuries and in the savour of fame Gilbert Elliott of the
Cauldstaneslap; but his sons had scarce less glory out of the
business.&nbsp; Their savage haste, the skill with which Dand had
found and followed the trail, the barbarity to the wounded
Dickieson (which was like an open secret in the county), and the
doom which it was currently supposed they had intended for the
others, struck and stirred popular imagination.&nbsp; Some
century earlier the last of the minstrels might have fashioned
the last of the ballads out of that Homeric fight and chase; but
the spirit was dead, or had been reincarnated already in Mr.
Sheriff Scott, and the degenerate moorsmen must be content to
tell the tale in prose, and to make of the “Four Black
Brothers” a unit after the fashion of the “Twelve
Apostles” or the “Three Musketeers.”</p>
<p>Robert, Gilbert, Clement, and Andrew—in the proper
Border diminutives, Hob, Gib, Clem, and Dand Elliott—these
ballad heroes, had much in common; in particular, their high
sense of the family and the family honour; but they went diverse
ways, and prospered and failed in different businesses.&nbsp;
According to Kirstie, “they had a’ bees in their
bonnets but Hob.”&nbsp; Hob the laird was, indeed,
essentially a decent man.&nbsp; An elder of the Kirk, nobody had
heard an oath upon his lips, save perhaps thrice or so at the
sheep-washing, since the chase of his father’s
murderers.&nbsp; The figure he had shown on that eventful night
disappeared as if swallowed by a trap.&nbsp; He who had
ecstatically dipped his hand in the red blood, he who had ridden
down Dickieson, became, from that moment on, a stiff and rather
graceless model of the rustic proprieties; cannily profiting by
the high war prices, and yearly stowing away a little nest-egg in
the bank against calamity; approved of and sometimes consulted by
the greater lairds for the massive and placid sense of what he
said, when he could be induced to say anything; and particularly
valued by the minister, Mr. Torrance, as a right-hand man in the
parish, and a model to parents.&nbsp; The transfiguration had
been for the moment only; some Barbarossa, some old Adam of our
ancestors, sleeps in all of us till the fit circumstance shall
call it into action; and, for as sober as he now seemed, Hob had
given once for all the measure of the devil that haunted
him.&nbsp; He was married, and, by reason of the effulgence of
that legendary night, was adored by his wife.&nbsp; He had a mob
of little lusty, barefoot children who marched in a caravan the
long miles to school, the stages of whose pilgrimage were marked
by acts of spoliation and mischief, and who were qualified in the
country-side as “fair pests.”&nbsp; But in the house,
if “faither was in,” they were quiet as mice.&nbsp;
In short, Hob moved through life in a great peace—the
reward of any one who shall have killed his man, with any
formidable and figurative circumstance, in the midst of a country
gagged and swaddled with civilisation.</p>
<p>It was a current remark that the Elliotts were “guid and
bad, like sanguishes”; and certainly there was a curious
distinction, the men of business coming alternately with the
dreamers.&nbsp; The second brother, Gib, was a weaver by trade,
had gone out early into the world to Edinburgh, and come home
again with his wings singed.&nbsp; There was an exaltation in his
nature which had led him to embrace with enthusiasm the
principles of the French Revolution, and had ended by bringing
him under the hawse of my Lord Hermiston in that furious
onslaught of his upon the Liberals, which sent Muir and Palmer
into exile and dashed the party into chaff.&nbsp; It was
whispered that my lord, in his great scorn for the movement, and
prevailed upon a little by a sense of neighbourliness, had given
Gib a hint.&nbsp; Meeting him one day in the Potterrow, my lord
had stopped in front of him: “Gib, ye eediot,” he had
said, “what’s this I hear of you? Poalitics,
poalitics, poalitics, weaver’s poalitics, is the way of it,
I hear.&nbsp; If ye arena a’thegither dozened with cediocy,
ye’ll gang your ways back to Cauldstaneslap, and ca’
your loom, and ca’ your loom, man!” And Gilbert had
taken him at the word and returned, with an expedition almost to
be called flight, to the house of his father.&nbsp; The clearest
of his inheritance was that family gift of prayer of which
Kirstie had boasted; and the baffled politician now turned his
attention to religious matters—or, as others said, to
heresy and schism.&nbsp; Every Sunday morning he was in
Crossmichael, where he had gathered together, one by one, a sect
of about a dozen persons, who called themselves
“God’s Remnant of the True Faithful,” or, for
short, “God’s Remnant.” To the profane, they
were known as “Gib’s Deils.”&nbsp; Bailie
Sweedie, a noted humorist in the town, vowed that the proceedings
always opened to the tune of “The Deil Fly Away with the
Exciseman,” and that the sacrament was dispensed in the
form of hot whisky-toddy; both wicked hits at the evangelist, who
had been suspected of smuggling in his youth, and had been
overtaken (as the phrase went) on the streets of Crossmichael one
Fair day.&nbsp; It was known that every Sunday they prayed for a
blessing on the arms of Bonaparte.&nbsp; For this
“God’s Remnant,” as they were
“skailing” from the cottage that did duty for a
temple, had been repeatedly stoned by the bairns, and Gib himself
hooted by a squadron of Border volunteers in which his own
brother, Dand, rode in a uniform and with a drawn sword.&nbsp;
The “Remnant” were believed, besides, to be
“antinomian in principle,” which might otherwise have
been a serious charge, but the way public opinion then blew it
was quite swallowed up and forgotten in the scandal about
Bonaparte.&nbsp; For the rest, Gilbert had set up his loom in an
outhouse at Cauldstaneslap, where he laboured assiduously six
days of the week.&nbsp; His brothers, appalled by his political
opinions, and willing to avoid dissension in the household, spoke
but little to him; he less to them, remaining absorbed in the
study of the Bible and almost constant prayer.&nbsp; The gaunt
weaver was dry-nurse at Cauldstaneslap, and the bairns loved him
dearly.&nbsp; Except when he was carrying an infant in his arms,
he was rarely seen to smile—as, indeed, there were few
smilers in that family.&nbsp; When his sister-in-law rallied him,
and proposed that he should get a wife and bairns of his own,
since he was so fond of them, “I have no clearness of mind
upon that point,” he would reply.&nbsp; If nobody called
him in to dinner, he stayed out.&nbsp; Mrs. Hob, a hard,
unsympathetic woman, once tried the experiment.&nbsp; He went
without food all day, but at dusk, as the light began to fail
him, he came into the house of his own accord, looking
puzzled.&nbsp; “I’ve had a great gale of prayer upon
my speerit,” said he.&nbsp; “I canna mind sae
muckle’s what I had for denner.” The creed of
God’s Remnant was justified in the life of its
founder.&nbsp; “And yet I dinna ken,” said
Kirstie.&nbsp; “He’s maybe no more stockfish than his
neeghbours!&nbsp; He rode wi’ the rest o’ them, and
had a good stamach to the work, by a’ that I hear!&nbsp;
God’s Remnant!&nbsp; The deil’s clavers!&nbsp; There
wasna muckle Christianity in the way Hob guided Johnny Dickieson,
at the least of it; but Guid kens!&nbsp; Is he a Christian
even?&nbsp; He might be a Mahommedan or a Deevil or a
Fire-worshipper, for what I ken.”</p>
<p>The third brother had his name on a door-plate, no less, in
the city of Glasgow, “Mr. Clement Elliott,” as long
as your arm.&nbsp; In his case, that spirit of innovation which
had shown itself timidly in the case of Hob by the admission of
new manures, and which had run to waste with Gilbert in
subversive politics and heretical religions, bore useful fruit in
many ingenious mechanical improvements.&nbsp; In boyhood, from
his addiction to strange devices of sticks and string, he had
been counted the most eccentric of the family.&nbsp; But that was
all by now; and he was a partner of his firm, and looked to die a
bailie.&nbsp; He too had married, and was rearing a plentiful
family in the smoke and din of Glasgow; he was wealthy, and could
have bought out his brother, the cock-laird, six times over, it
was whispered; and when he slipped away to Cauldstaneslap for a
well-earned holiday, which he did as often as he was able, he
astonished the neighbours with his broadcloth, his beaver hat,
and the ample plies of his neckcloth.&nbsp; Though an eminently
solid man at bottom, after the pattern of Hob, he had contracted
a certain Glasgow briskness and <i>aplomb</i> which set him
off.&nbsp; All the other Elliotts were as lean as a rake, but
Clement was laying on fat, and he panted sorely when he must get
into his boots.&nbsp; Dand said, chuckling: “Ay, Clem has
the elements of a corporation.”&nbsp; “A provost and
corporation,” returned Clem.&nbsp; And his readiness was
much admired.</p>
<p>The fourth brother, Dand, was a shepherd to his trade, and by
starts, when he could bring his mind to it, excelled in the
business.&nbsp; Nobody could train a dog like Dandie; nobody,
through the peril of great storms in the winter time, could do
more gallantly.&nbsp; But if his dexterity were exquisite, his
diligence was but fitful; and he served his brother for bed and
board, and a trifle of pocket-money when he asked for it.&nbsp;
He loved money well enough, knew very well how to spend it, and
could make a shrewd bargain when he liked.&nbsp; But he preferred
a vague knowledge that he was well to windward to any counted
coins in the pocket; he felt himself richer so.&nbsp; Hob would
expostulate: “I’m an amature herd.”&nbsp; Dand
would reply, “I’ll keep your sheep to you when
I’m so minded, but I’ll keep my liberty too.&nbsp;
Thir’s no man can coandescend on what I’m
worth.” Clein would expound to him the miraculous results
of compound interest, and recommend investments.&nbsp; “Ay,
man?” Dand would say; “and do you think, if I took
Hob’s siller, that I wouldna drink it or wear it on the
lassies?&nbsp; And, anyway, my kingdom is no of this world.&nbsp;
Either I’m a poet or else I’m nothing.”&nbsp;
Clem would remind him of old age.&nbsp; “I’ll die
young, like, Robbie Burns,” he would say stoutly.&nbsp; No
question but he had a certain accomplishment in minor
verse.&nbsp; His “Hermiston Burn,” with its pretty
refrain—</p>
<blockquote><p>“I love to gang thinking whaur ye gang
linking,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hermiston burn,
in the howe;”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>his “Auld, auld Elliotts, clay-cauld Elliotts, dour,
bauld Elliotts of auld,” and his really fascinating piece
about the Praying Weaver’s Stone, had gained him in the
neighbourhood the reputation, still possible in Scotland, of a
local bard; and, though not printed himself, he was recognised by
others who were and who had become famous.&nbsp; Walter Scott
owed to Dandie the text of the “Raid of Wearie” in
the <i>Minstrelsy</i>; and made him welcome at his house, and
appreciated his talents, such as they were, with all his usual
generosity.&nbsp; The Ettrick Shepherd was his sworn crony; they
would meet, drink to excess, roar out their lyrics in each
other’s faces, and quarrel and make it up again till
bedtime.&nbsp; And besides these recognitions, almost to be
called official, Dandie was made welcome for the sake of his gift
through the farmhouses of several contiguous dales, and was thus
exposed to manifold temptations which he rather sought than
fled.&nbsp; He had figured on the stool of repentance, for once
fulfilling to the letter the tradition of his hero and
model.&nbsp; His humorous verses to Mr. Torrance on that
occasion—“Kenspeckle here my lane I
stand”—unfortunately too indelicate for further
citation, ran through the country like a fiery cross—they
were recited, quoted, paraphrased, and laughed over as far away
as Dumfries on the one hand and Dunbar on the other.</p>
<p>These four brothers were united by a close bond, the bond of
that mutual admiration—or rather mutual
hero-worship—which is so strong among the members of
secluded families who have much ability and little culture.&nbsp;
Even the extremes admired each other.&nbsp; Hob, who had as much
poetry as the tongs, professed to find pleasure in Dand’s
verses; Clem, who had no more religion than Claverhouse,
nourished a heartfelt, at least an open-mouthed, admiration of
Gib’s prayers; and Dandie followed with relish the rise of
Clem’s fortunes.&nbsp; Indulgence followed hard on the
heels of admiration.&nbsp; The laird, Clem, and Dand, who were
Tories and patriots of the hottest quality, excused to
themselves, with a certain bashfulness, the radical and
revolutionary heresies of Gib.&nbsp; By another division of the
family, the laird, Clem, and Gib, who were men exactly virtuous,
swallowed the dose of Dand’s irregularities as a kind of
clog or drawback in the mysterious providence of God affixed to
bards, and distinctly probative of poetical genius.&nbsp; To
appreciate the simplicity of their mutual admiration it was
necessary to hear Clem, arrived upon one of his visits, and
dealing in a spirit of continuous irony with the affairs and
personalities of that great city of Glasgow where he lived and
transacted business.&nbsp; The various personages, ministers of
the church, municipal officers, mercantile big-wigs, whom he had
occasion to introduce, were all alike denigrated, all served but
as reflectors to cast back a flattering side-light on the house
of Cauldstaneslap.&nbsp; The Provost, for whom Clem by exception
entertained a measure of respect, he would liken to Hob.&nbsp;
“He minds me o’ the laird there,” he would
say.&nbsp; “He has some of Hob’s grand, whunstane
sense, and the same way with him of steiking his mouth when
he’s no very pleased.”&nbsp; And Hob, all
unconscious, would draw down his upper lip and produce, as if for
comparison, the formidable grimace referred to.&nbsp; The
unsatisfactory incumbent of St. Enoch’s Kirk was thus
briefly dismissed: “If he had but twa fingers o’
Gib’s, he would waken them up.”&nbsp; And Gib, honest
man! would look down and secretly smile.&nbsp; Clem was a spy
whom they had sent out into the world of men.&nbsp; He had come
back with the good news that there was nobody to compare with the
Four Black Brothers, no position that they would not adorn, no
official that it would not be well they should replace, no
interest of mankind, secular or spiritual, which would not
immediately bloom under their supervision.&nbsp; The excuse of
their folly is in two words: scarce the breadth of a hair divided
them from the peasantry.&nbsp; The measure of their sense is
this: that these symposia of rustic vanity were kept entirely
within the family, like some secret ancestral practice.&nbsp; To
the world their serious faces were never deformed by the
suspicion of any simper of self-contentment.&nbsp; Yet it was
known.&nbsp; “They hae a guid pride o’
themsel’s!” was the word in the country-side.</p>
<p>Lastly, in a Border story, there should be added their
“two-names.”&nbsp; Hob was The Laird.&nbsp;
“Roy ne puis, prince ne daigne”; he was the laird of
Cauldstaneslap—say fifty
acres—<i>ipsissimus</i>.&nbsp; Clement was Mr. Elliott, as
upon his door-plate, the earlier Dafty having been discarded as
no longer applicable, and indeed only a reminder of misjudgment
and the imbecility of the public; and the youngest, in honour of
his perpetual wanderings, was known by the sobriquet of Randy
Dand.</p>
<p>It will be understood that not all this information was
communicated by the aunt, who had too much of the family failing
herself to appreciate it thoroughly in others.&nbsp; But as time
went on, Archie began to observe an omission in the family
chronicle.</p>
<p>“Is there not a girl too?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Ay: Kirstie.&nbsp; She was named for me, or my
grandmother at least—it’s the same thing,”
returned the aunt, and went on again about Dand, whom she
secretly preferred by reason of his gallantries.</p>
<p>“But what is your niece like?” said Archie at the
next opportunity.</p>
<p>“Her?&nbsp; As black’s your hat!&nbsp; But I dinna
suppose she would maybe be what you would ca’
<i>ill-looked</i> a’thegither.&nbsp; Na, she’s a kind
of a handsome jaud—a kind o’ gipsy,” said the
aunt, who had two sets of scales for men and women—or
perhaps it would be more fair to say that she had three, and the
third and the most loaded was for girls.</p>
<p>“How comes it that I never see her in church?”
said Archie.</p>
<p>“’Deed, and I believe she’s in Glesgie with
Clem and his wife.&nbsp; A heap good she’s like to get of
it!&nbsp; I dinna say for men folk, but where weemen folk are
born, there let them bide.&nbsp; Glory to God, I was never
far’er from here than Crossmichael.”</p>
<p>In the meanwhile it began to strike Archie as strange, that
while she thus sang the praises of her kinsfolk, and manifestly
relished their virtues and (I may say) their vices like a thing
creditable to herself, there should appear not the least sign of
cordiality between the house of Hermiston and that of
Cauldstaneslap.&nbsp; Going to church of a Sunday, as the lady
housekeeper stepped with her skirts kilted, three tucks of her
white petticoat showing below, and her best India shawl upon her
back (if the day were fine) in a pattern of radiant dyes, she
would sometimes overtake her relatives preceding her more
leisurely in the same direction.&nbsp; Gib of course was absent:
by skreigh of day he had been gone to Crossmichael and his
fellow-heretics; but the rest of the family would be seen
marching in open order: Hob and Dand, stiff-necked,
straight-backed six-footers, with severe dark faces, and their
plaids about their shoulders; the convoy of children scattering
(in a state of high polish) on the wayside, and every now and
again collected by the shrill summons of the mother; and the
mother herself, by a suggestive circumstance which might have
afforded matter of thought to a more experienced observer than
Archie, wrapped in a shawl nearly identical with Kirstie’s,
but a thought more gaudy and conspicuously newer.&nbsp; At the
sight, Kirstie grew more tall—Kirstie showed her classical
profile, nose in air and nostril spread, the pure blood came in
her cheek evenly in a delicate living pink.</p>
<p>“A braw day to ye, Mistress Elliott,” said she,
and hostility and gentility were nicely mingled in her
tones.&nbsp; “A fine day, mem,” the laird’s
wife would reply with a miraculous curtsey, spreading the while
her plumage—setting off, in other words, and with arts
unknown to the mere man, the pattern of her India shawl.&nbsp;
Behind her, the whole Cauldstaneslap contingent marched in closer
order, and with an indescribable air of being in the presence of
the foe; and while Dandie saluted his aunt with a certain
familiarity as of one who was well in court, Hob marched on in
awful immobility.&nbsp; There appeared upon the face of this
attitude in the family the consequences of some dreadful
feud.&nbsp; Presumably the two women had been principals in the
original encounter, and the laird had probably been drawn into
the quarrel by the ears, too late to be included in the present
skin-deep reconciliation.</p>
<p>“Kirstie,” said Archie one day, “what is
this you have against your family?”</p>
<p>“I dinna complean,” said Kirstie, with a
flush.&nbsp; “I say naething.”</p>
<p>“I see you do not—not even good-day to your own
nephew,” said he.</p>
<p>“I hae naething to be ashamed of,” said she.&nbsp;
“I can say the Lord’s prayer with a good grace.&nbsp;
If Hob was ill, or in preeson or poverty, I would see to him
blithely.&nbsp; But for curtchying and complimenting and
colloguing, thank ye kindly!”</p>
<p>Archie had a bit of a smile: he leaned back in his
chair.&nbsp; “I think you and Mrs. Robert are not very good
friends,” says he slyly, “when you have your India
shawls on?”</p>
<p>She looked upon him in silence, with a sparkling eye but an
indecipherable expression; and that was all that Archie was ever
destined to learn of the battle of the India shawls.</p>
<p>“Do none of them ever come here to see you?” he
inquired.</p>
<p>“Mr. Archie,” said she, “I hope that I ken
my place better.&nbsp; It would be a queer thing, I think, if I
was to clamjamfry up your faither’s house—that I
should say it!—wi’ a dirty, black-a-vised clan, no
ane o’ them it was worth while to mar soap upon but just
mysel’!&nbsp; Na, they’re all damnifeed wi’ the
black Ellwalds.&nbsp; I have nae patience wi’ black
folk.” Then, with a sudden consciousness of the case of
Archie, “No that it maitters for men sae muckle,” she
made haste to add, “but there’s naebody can deny that
it’s unwomanly.&nbsp; Long hair is the ornament o’
woman ony way; we’ve good warrandise for
that—it’s in the Bible—and wha can doubt that
the Apostle had some gowden-haired lassie in his
mind—Apostle and all, for what was he but just a man like
yersel’?”</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI—A LEAF FROM CHRISTINA’S
PSALM-BOOK</h2>
<p>Archie was sedulous at church.&nbsp; Sunday after Sunday he
sat down and stood up with that small company, heard the voice of
Mr. Torrance leaping like an ill-played clarionet from key to
key, and had an opportunity to study his moth-eaten gown and the
black thread mittens that he joined together in prayer, and
lifted up with a reverent solemnity in the act of
benediction.&nbsp; Hermiston pew was a little square box,
dwarfish in proportion with the kirk itself, and enclosing a
table not much bigger than a footstool.&nbsp; There sat Archie,
an apparent prince, the only undeniable gentleman and the only
great heritor in the parish, taking his ease in the only pew, for
no other in the kirk had doors.&nbsp; Thence he might command an
undisturbed view of that congregation of solid plaided men,
strapping wives and daughters, oppressed children, and uneasy
sheep-dogs.&nbsp; It was strange how Archie missed the look of
race; except the dogs, with their refined foxy faces and
inimitably curling tails, there was no one present with the least
claim to gentility.&nbsp; The Cauldstaneslap party was scarcely
an exception; Dandie perhaps, as he amused himself making verses
through the interminable burden of the service, stood out a
little by the glow in his eye and a certain superior animation of
face and alertness of body; but even Dandie slouched like a
rustic.&nbsp; The rest of the congregation, like so many sheep,
oppressed him with a sense of hob-nailed routine, day following
day—of physical labour in the open air, oatmeal porridge,
peas bannock the somnolent fireside in the evening, and the
night-long nasal slumbers in a box-bed.&nbsp; Yet he knew many of
them to be shrewd and humorous, men of character, notable women,
making a bustle in the world and radiating an influence from
their low-browed doors.&nbsp; He knew besides they were like
other men; below the crust of custom, rapture found a way; he had
heard them beat the timbrel before Bacchus—had heard them
shout and carouse over their whisky-toddy; and not the most
Dutch-bottomed and severe faces among them all, not even the
solemn elders themselves, but were capable of singular gambols at
the voice of love.&nbsp; Men drawing near to an end of
life’s adventurous journey—maids thrilling with fear
and curiosity on the threshold of entrance—women who had
borne and perhaps buried children, who could remember the
clinging of the small dead hands and the patter of the little
feet now silent—he marvelled that among all those faces
there should be no face of expectation, none that was mobile,
none into which the rhythm and poetry of life had entered.&nbsp;
“O for a live face,” he thought; and at times he had
a memory of Lady Flora; and at times he would study the living
gallery before him with despair, and would see himself go on to
waste his days in that joyless pastoral place, and death come to
him, and his grave be dug under the rowans, and the Spirit of the
Earth laugh out in a thunder-peal at the huge fiasco.</p>
<p>On this particular Sunday, there was no doubt but that the
spring had come at last.&nbsp; It was warm, with a latent shiver
in the air that made the warmth only the more welcome.&nbsp; The
shallows of the stream glittered and tinkled among bunches of
primrose.&nbsp; Vagrant scents of the earth arrested Archie by
the way with moments of ethereal intoxication.&nbsp; The grey
Quakerish dale was still only awakened in places and patches from
the sobriety of its winter colouring; and he wondered at its
beauty; an essential beauty of the old earth it seemed to him,
not resident in particulars but breathing to him from the
whole.&nbsp; He surprised himself by a sudden impulse to write
poetry—he did so sometimes, loose, galloping octo-syllabics
in the vein of Scott—and when he had taken his place on a
boulder, near some fairy falls and shaded by a whip of a tree
that was already radiant with new leaves, it still more surprised
him that he should have nothing to write.&nbsp; His heart perhaps
beat in time to some vast indwelling rhythm of the
universe.&nbsp; By the time he came to a corner of the valley and
could see the kirk, he had so lingered by the way that the first
psalm was finishing.&nbsp; The nasal psalmody, full of turns and
trills and graceless graces, seemed the essential voice of the
kirk itself upraised in thanksgiving, “Everything’s
alive,” he said; and again cries it aloud, “thank
God, everything’s alive!”&nbsp; He lingered yet a
while in the kirk-yard.&nbsp; A tuft of primroses was blooming
hard by the leg of an old black table tombstone, and he stopped
to contemplate the random apologue.&nbsp; They stood forth on the
cold earth with a trenchancy of contrast; and he was struck with
a sense of incompleteness in the day, the season, and the beauty
that surrounded him—the chill there was in the warmth, the
gross black clods about the opening primroses, the damp earthy
smell that was everywhere intermingled with the scents.&nbsp; The
voice of the aged Torrance within rose in an ecstasy.&nbsp; And
he wondered if Torrance also felt in his old bones the joyous
influence of the spring morning; Torrance, or the shadow of what
once was Torrance, that must come so soon to lie outside here in
the sun and rain with all his rheumatisms, while a new minister
stood in his room and thundered from his own familiar
pulpit?&nbsp; The pity of it, and something of the chill of the
grave, shook him for a moment as he made haste to enter.</p>
<p>He went up the aisle reverently, and took his place in the pew
with lowered eyes, for he feared he had already offended the kind
old gentleman in the pulpit, and was sedulous to offend no
further.&nbsp; He could not follow the prayer, not even the heads
of it.&nbsp; Brightnesses of azure, clouds of fragrance, a tinkle
of falling water and singing birds, rose like exhalations from
some deeper, aboriginal memory, that was not his, but belonged to
the flesh on his bones.&nbsp; His body remembered; and it seemed
to him that his body was in no way gross, but ethereal and
perishable like a strain of music; and he felt for it an
exquisite tenderness as for a child, an innocent, full of
beautiful instincts and destined to an early death.&nbsp; And he
felt for old Torrance—of the many supplications, of the few
days—a pity that was near to tears.&nbsp; The prayer
ended.&nbsp; Right over him was a tablet in the wall, the only
ornament in the roughly masoned chapel—for it was no more;
the tablet commemorated, I was about to say the virtues, but
rather the existence of a former Rutherford of Hermiston; and
Archie, under that trophy of his long descent and local
greatness, leaned back in the pew and contemplated vacancy with
the shadow of a smile between playful and sad, that became him
strangely.&nbsp; Dandie’s sister, sitting by the side of
Clem in her new Glasgow finery, chose that moment to observe the
young laird.&nbsp; Aware of the stir of his entrance, the little
formalist had kept her eyes fastened and her face prettily
composed during the prayer.&nbsp; It was not hypocrisy, there was
no one further from a hypocrite.&nbsp; The girl had been taught
to behave: to look up, to look down, to look unconscious, to look
seriously impressed in church, and in every conjuncture to look
her best.&nbsp; That was the game of female life, and she played
it frankly.&nbsp; Archie was the one person in church who was of
interest, who was somebody new, reputed eccentric, known to be
young, and a laird, and still unseen by Christina.&nbsp; Small
wonder that, as she stood there in her attitude of pretty
decency, her mind should run upon him!&nbsp; If he spared a
glance in her direction, he should know she was a well-behaved
young lady who had been to Glasgow.&nbsp; In reason he must
admire her clothes, and it was possible that he should think her
pretty.&nbsp; At that her heart beat the least thing in the
world; and she proceeded, by way of a corrective, to call up and
dismiss a series of fancied pictures of the young man who should
now, by rights, be looking at her.&nbsp; She settled on the
plainest of them,—a pink short young man with a dish face
and no figure, at whose admiration she could afford to smile; but
for all that, the consciousness of his gaze (which was really
fixed on Torrance and his mittens) kept her in something of a
flutter till the word Amen.&nbsp; Even then, she was far too
well-bred to gratify her curiosity with any impatience.&nbsp; She
resumed her seat languidly—this was a Glasgow
touch—she composed her dress, rearranged her nosegay of
primroses, looked first in front, then behind upon the other
side, and at last allowed her eyes to move, without hurry, in the
direction of the Hermiston pew.&nbsp; For a moment, they were
riveted.&nbsp; Next she had plucked her gaze home again like a
tame bird who should have meditated flight.&nbsp; Possibilities
crowded on her; she hung over the future and grew dizzy; the
image of this young man, slim, graceful, dark, with the
inscrutable half-smile, attracted and repelled her like a
chasm.&nbsp; “I wonder, will I have met my fate?” she
thought, and her heart swelled.</p>
<p>Torrance was got some way into his first exposition, positing
a deep layer of texts as he went along, laying the foundations of
his discourse, which was to deal with a nice point in divinity,
before Archie suffered his eyes to wander.&nbsp; They fell first
of all on Clem, looking insupportably prosperous, and patronising
Torrance with the favour of a modified attention, as of one who
was used to better things in Glasgow.&nbsp; Though he had never
before set eyes on him, Archie had no difficulty in identifying
him, and no hesitation in pronouncing him vulgar, the worst of
the family.&nbsp; Clem was leaning lazily forward when Archie
first saw him.&nbsp; Presently he leaned nonchalantly back; and
that deadly instrument, the maiden, was suddenly unmasked in
profile.&nbsp; Though not quite in the front of the fashion (had
anybody cared!), certain artful Glasgow mantua-makers, and her
own inherent taste, had arrayed her to great advantage.&nbsp; Her
accoutrement was, indeed, a cause of heart-burning, and almost of
scandal, in that infinitesimal kirk company.&nbsp; Mrs. Hob had
said her say at Cauldstaneslap.&nbsp; “Daft-like!”
she had pronounced it.&nbsp; “A jaiket that’ll no
meet!&nbsp; Whaur’s the sense of a jaiket that’ll no
button upon you, if it should come to be weet?&nbsp; What do ye
ca’ thir things?&nbsp; Demmy brokens, d’ye say?&nbsp;
They’ll be brokens wi’ a vengeance or ye can win
back!&nbsp; Weel, I have nae thing to do wi’
it—it’s no good taste.”&nbsp; Clem, whose purse
had thus metamorphosed his sister, and who was not insensible to
the advertisement, had come to the rescue with a “Hoot,
woman!&nbsp; What do you ken of good taste that has never been to
the ceety?”&nbsp; And Hob, looking on the girl with pleased
smiles, as she timidly displayed her finery in the midst of the
dark kitchen, had thus ended the dispute: “The cutty looks
weel,” he had said, “and it’s no very like
rain.&nbsp; Wear them the day, hizzie; but it’s no a thing
to make a practice o’.”&nbsp; In the breasts of her
rivals, coming to the kirk very conscious of white under-linen,
and their faces splendid with much soap, the sight of the toilet
had raised a storm of varying emotion, from the mere unenvious
admiration that was expressed in a long-drawn “Eh!”
to the angrier feeling that found vent in an emphatic “Set
her up!”&nbsp; Her frock was of straw-coloured jaconet
muslin, cut low at the bosom and short at the ankle, so as to
display her <i>demi-broquins</i> of Regency violet, crossing with
many straps upon a yellow cobweb stocking.&nbsp; According to the
pretty fashion in which our grandmothers did not hesitate to
appear, and our great-aunts went forth armed for the pursuit and
capture of our great-uncles, the dress was drawn up so as to
mould the contour of both breasts, and in the nook between, a
cairngorm brooch maintained it.&nbsp; Here, too, surely in a very
enviable position, trembled the nosegay of primroses.&nbsp; She
wore on her shoulders—or rather on her back and not her
shoulders, which it scarcely passed—a French coat of
sarsenet, tied in front with Margate braces, and of the same
colour with her violet shoes.&nbsp; About her face clustered a
disorder of dark ringlets, a little garland of yellow French
roses surmounted her brow, and the whole was crowned by a village
hat of chipped straw.&nbsp; Amongst all the rosy and all the
weathered faces that surrounded her in church, she glowed like an
open flower—girl and raiment, and the cairngorm that caught
the daylight and returned it in a fiery flash, and the threads of
bronze and gold that played in her hair.</p>
<p>Archie was attracted by the bright thing like a child.&nbsp;
He looked at her again and yet again, and their looks
crossed.&nbsp; The lip was lifted from her little teeth.&nbsp; He
saw the red blood work vividly under her tawny skin.&nbsp; Her
eye, which was great as a stag’s, struck and held his
gaze.&nbsp; He knew who she must be—Kirstie, she of the
harsh diminutive, his housekeeper’s niece, the sister of
the rustic prophet, Gib—and he found in her the answer to
his wishes.</p>
<p>Christina felt the shock of their encountering glances, and
seemed to rise, clothed in smiles, into a region of the vague and
bright.&nbsp; But the gratification was not more exquisite than
it was brief.&nbsp; She looked away abruptly, and immediately
began to blame herself for that abruptness.&nbsp; She knew what
she should have done, too late—turned slowly with her nose
in the air.&nbsp; And meantime his look was not removed, but
continued to play upon her like a battery of cannon constantly
aimed, and now seemed to isolate her alone with him, and now
seemed to uplift her, as on a pillory, before the
congregation.&nbsp; For Archie continued to drink her in with his
eyes, even as a wayfarer comes to a well-head on a mountain, and
stoops his face, and drinks with thirst unassuageable.&nbsp; In
the cleft of her little breasts the fiery eye of the topaz and
the pale florets of primrose fascinated him.&nbsp; He saw the
breasts heave, and the flowers shake with the heaving, and
marvelled what should so much discompose the girl.&nbsp; And
Christina was conscious of his gaze—saw it, perhaps, with
the dainty plaything of an ear that peeped among her ringlets;
she was conscious of changing colour, conscious of her unsteady
breath.&nbsp; Like a creature tracked, run down, surrounded, she
sought in a dozen ways to give herself a countenance.&nbsp; She
used her handkerchief—it was a really fine one—then
she desisted in a panic: “He would only think I was too
warm.”&nbsp; She took to reading in the metrical psalms,
and then remembered it was sermon-time.&nbsp; Last she put a
“sugar-bool” in her mouth, and the next moment
repented of the step.&nbsp; It was such a homely-like
thing!&nbsp; Mr. Archie would never be eating sweeties in kirk;
and, with a palpable effort, she swallowed it whole, and her
colour flamed high.&nbsp; At this signal of distress Archie awoke
to a sense of his ill-behaviour.&nbsp; What had he been
doing?&nbsp; He had been exquisitely rude in church to the niece
of his housekeeper; he had stared like a lackey and a libertine
at a beautiful and modest girl.&nbsp; It was possible, it was
even likely, he would be presented to her after service in the
kirk-yard, and then how was he to look?&nbsp; And there was no
excuse.&nbsp; He had marked the tokens of her shame, of her
increasing indignation, and he was such a fool that he had not
understood them.&nbsp; Shame bowed him down, and he looked
resolutely at Mr. Torrance; who little supposed, good, worthy
man, as he continued to expound justification by faith, what was
his true business: to play the part of derivative to a pair of
children at the old game of falling in love.</p>
<p>Christina was greatly relieved at first.&nbsp; It seemed to
her that she was clothed again.&nbsp; She looked back on what had
passed.&nbsp; All would have been right if she had not blushed, a
silly fool!&nbsp; There was nothing to blush at, if she
<i>had</i> taken a sugar-bool.&nbsp; Mrs. MacTaggart, the
elder’s wife in St. Enoch’s, took them often.&nbsp;
And if he had looked at her, what was more natural than that a
young gentleman should look at the best-dressed girl in
church?&nbsp; And at the same time, she knew far otherwise, she
knew there was nothing casual or ordinary in the look, and valued
herself on its memory like a decoration.&nbsp; Well, it was a
blessing he had found something else to look at!&nbsp; And
presently she began to have other thoughts.&nbsp; It was
necessary, she fancied, that she should put herself right by a
repetition of the incident, better managed.&nbsp; If the wish was
father to the thought, she did not know or she would not
recognise it.&nbsp; It was simply as a manœuvre of
propriety, as something called for to lessen the significance of
what had gone before, that she should a second time meet his
eyes, and this time without blushing.&nbsp; And at the memory of
the blush, she blushed again, and became one general blush
burning from head to foot.&nbsp; Was ever anything so indelicate,
so forward, done by a girl before?&nbsp; And here she was, making
an exhibition of herself before the congregation about
nothing!&nbsp; She stole a glance upon her neighbours, and
behold! they were steadily indifferent, and Clem had gone to
sleep.&nbsp; And still the one idea was becoming more and more
potent with her, that in common prudence she must look again
before the service ended.&nbsp; Something of the same sort was
going forward in the mind of Archie, as he struggled with the
load of penitence.&nbsp; So it chanced that, in the flutter of
the moment when the last psalm was given out, and Torrance was
reading the verse, and the leaves of every psalm-book in church
were rustling under busy fingers, two stealthy glances were sent
out like antennæ among the pews and on the indifferent and
absorbed occupants, and drew timidly nearer to the straight line
between Archie and Christina.&nbsp; They met, they lingered
together for the least fraction of time, and that was
enough.&nbsp; A charge as of electricity passed through
Christina, and behold! the leaf of her psalm-book was torn
across.</p>
<p>Archie was outside by the gate of the graveyard, conversing
with Hob and the minister and shaking hands all round with the
scattering congregation, when Clem and Christina were brought up
to be presented.&nbsp; The laird took off his hat and bowed to
her with grace and respect.&nbsp; Christina made her Glasgow
curtsey to the laird, and went on again up the road for Hermiston
and Cauldstaneslap, walking fast, breathing hurriedly with a
heightened colour, and in this strange frame of mind, that when
she was alone she seemed in high happiness, and when any one
addressed her she resented it like a contradiction.&nbsp; A part
of the way she had the company of some neighbour girls and a
loutish young man; never had they seemed so insipid, never had
she made herself so disagreeable.&nbsp; But these struck aside to
their various destinations or were out-walked and left behind;
and when she had driven off with sharp words the proffered convoy
of some of her nephews and nieces, she was free to go on alone up
Hermiston brae, walking on air, dwelling intoxicated among clouds
of happiness.&nbsp; Near to the summit she heard steps behind
her, a man’s steps, light and very rapid.&nbsp; She knew
the foot at once and walked the faster.&nbsp; “If
it’s me he’s wanting, he can run for it,” she
thought, smiling.</p>
<p>Archie overtook her like a man whose mind was made up.</p>
<p>“Miss Kirstie,” he began.</p>
<p>“Miss Christina, if you please, Mr. Weir,” she
interrupted.&nbsp; “I canna bear the
contraction.”</p>
<p>“You forget it has a friendly sound for me.&nbsp; Your
aunt is an old friend of mine, and a very good one.&nbsp; I hope
we shall see much of you at Hermiston?”</p>
<p>“My aunt and my sister-in-law doesna agree very
well.&nbsp; Not that I have much ado with it.&nbsp; But still
when I’m stopping in the house, if I was to be visiting my
aunt, it would not look considerate-like.”</p>
<p>“I am sorry,” said Archie.</p>
<p>“I thank you kindly, Mr. Weir,” she said.&nbsp;
“I whiles think myself it’s a great peety.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I am sure your voice would always be for
peace!” he cried.</p>
<p>“I wouldna be too sure of that,” she said.&nbsp;
“I have my days like other folk, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“Do you know, in our old kirk, among our good old grey
dames, you made an effect like sunshine.”</p>
<p>“Ah, but that would be my Glasgow clothes!”</p>
<p>“I did not think I was so much under the influence of
pretty frocks.”</p>
<p>She smiled with a half look at him.&nbsp; “There’s
more than you!” she said.&nbsp; “But you see
I’m only Cinderella.&nbsp; I’ll have to put all these
things by in my trunk; next Sunday I’ll be as grey as the
rest.&nbsp; They’re Glasgow clothes, you see, and it would
never do to make a practice of it.&nbsp; It would seem terrible
conspicuous.”</p>
<p>By that they were come to the place where their ways
severed.&nbsp; The old grey moors were all about them; in the
midst a few sheep wandered; and they could see on the one hand
the straggling caravan scaling the braes in front of them for
Cauldstaneslap, and on the other, the contingent from Hermiston
bending off and beginning to disappear by detachments into the
policy gate.&nbsp; It was in these circumstances that they turned
to say farewell, and deliberately exchanged a glance as they
shook hands.&nbsp; All passed as it should, genteelly; and in
Christina’s mind, as she mounted the first steep ascent for
Cauldstaneslap, a gratifying sense of triumph prevailed over the
recollection of minor lapses and mistakes.&nbsp; She had kilted
her gown, as she did usually at that rugged pass; but when she
spied Archie still standing and gazing after her, the skirts came
down again as if by enchantment.&nbsp; Here was a piece of nicety
for that upland parish, where the matrons marched with their
coats kilted in the rain, and the lasses walked barefoot to kirk
through the dust of summer, and went bravely down by the
burn-side, and sat on stones to make a public toilet before
entering!&nbsp; It was perhaps an air wafted from Glasgow; or
perhaps it marked a stage of that dizziness of gratified vanity,
in which the instinctive act passed unperceived.&nbsp; He was
looking after!&nbsp; She unloaded her bosom of a prodigious sigh
that was all pleasure, and betook herself to run.&nbsp; When she
had overtaken the stragglers of her family, she caught up the
niece whom she had so recently repulsed, and kissed and slapped
her, and drove her away again, and ran after her with pretty
cries and laughter.&nbsp; Perhaps she thought the laird might
still be looking!&nbsp; But it chanced the little scene came
under the view of eyes less favourable; for she overtook Mrs. Hob
marching with Clem and Dand.</p>
<p>“You’re shürely fey, lass!” quoth
Dandie.</p>
<p>“Think shame to yersel’, miss!” said the
strident Mrs. Hob.&nbsp; “Is this the gait to guide
yersel’ on the way hame frae kirk?&nbsp; You’re
shiirely no sponsible the day!&nbsp; And anyway I would mind my
guid claes.”</p>
<p>“Hoot!” said Christina, and went on before them
head in air, treading the rough track with the tread of a wild
doe.</p>
<p>She was in love with herself, her destiny, the air of the
hills, the benediction of the sun.&nbsp; All the way home, she
continued under the intoxication of these sky-scraping
spirits.&nbsp; At table she could talk freely of young Hermiston;
gave her opinion of him off-hand and with a loud voice, that he
was a handsome young gentleman, real well mannered and
sensible-like, but it was a pity he looked doleful.&nbsp;
Only—the moment after—a memory of his eyes in church
embarrassed her.&nbsp; But for this inconsiderable check, all
through meal-time she had a good appetite, and she kept them
laughing at table, until Gib (who had returned before them from
Crossmichael and his separative worship) reproved the whole of
them for their levity.</p>
<p>Singing “in to herself” as she went, her mind
still in the turmoil of a glad confusion, she rose and tripped
upstairs to a little loft, lighted by four panes in the gable,
where she slept with one of her nieces.&nbsp; The niece, who
followed her, presuming on “Auntie’s” high
spirits, was flounced out of the apartment with small ceremony,
and retired, smarting and half tearful, to bury her woes in the
byre among the hay.&nbsp; Still humming, Christina divested
herself of her finery, and put her treasures one by one in her
great green trunk.&nbsp; The last of these was the psalm-book; it
was a fine piece, the gift of Mistress Clem, in distinct
old-faced type, on paper that had begun to grow foxy in the
warehouse—not by service—and she was used to wrap it
in a handkerchief every Sunday after its period of service was
over, and bury it end-wise at the head of her trunk.&nbsp; As she
now took it in hand the book fell open where the leaf was torn,
and she stood and gazed upon that evidence of her bygone
discomposure.&nbsp; There returned again the vision of the two
brown eyes staring at her, intent and bright, out of that dark
corner of the kirk.&nbsp; The whole appearance and attitude, the
smile, the suggested gesture of young Hermiston came before her
in a flash at the sight of the torn page.&nbsp; “I was
surely fey!” she said, echoing the words of Dandie, and at
the suggested doom her high spirits deserted her.&nbsp; She flung
herself prone upon the bed, and lay there, holding the psalm-book
in her hands for hours, for the more part in a mere stupor of
unconsenting pleasure and unreasoning fear.&nbsp; The fear was
superstitious; there came up again and again in her memory
Dandie’s ill-omened words, and a hundred grisly and black
tales out of the immediate neighbourhood read her a commentary on
their force.&nbsp; The pleasure was never realised.&nbsp; You
might say the joints of her body thought and remembered, and were
gladdened, but her essential self, in the immediate theatre of
consciousness, talked feverishly of something else, like a
nervous person at a fire.&nbsp; The image that she most
complacently dwelt on was that of Miss Christina in her character
of the Fair Lass of Cauldstaneslap, carrying all before her in
the straw-coloured frock, the violet mantle, and the yellow
cobweb stockings.&nbsp; Archie’s image, on the other hand,
when it presented itself was never welcomed—far less
welcomed with any ardour, and it was exposed at times to
merciless criticism.&nbsp; In the long vague dialogues she held
in her mind, often with imaginary, often with unrealised
interlocutors, Archie, if he were referred to at all came in for
savage handling.&nbsp; He was described as “looking like a
stork,” “staring like a caulf,” “a face
like a ghaist’s.”&nbsp; “Do you call that
manners?” she said; or, “I soon put him in his
place.”&nbsp; “‘<i>Miss Christina</i>, <i>if
you please</i>, <i>Mr. Weir</i>!’ says I, and just flyped
up my skirt tails.”&nbsp; With gabble like this she would
entertain herself long whiles together, and then her eye would
perhaps fall on the torn leaf, and the eyes of Archie would
appear again from the darkness of the wall, and the voluble words
deserted her, and she would lie still and stupid, and think upon
nothing with devotion, and be sometimes raised by a quiet
sigh.&nbsp; Had a doctor of medicine come into that loft, he
would have diagnosed a healthy, well-developed, eminently
vivacious lass lying on her face in a fit of the sulks; not one
who had just contracted, or was just contracting, a mortal
sickness of the mind which should yet carry her towards death and
despair.&nbsp; Had it been a doctor of psychology, he might have
been pardoned for divining in the girl a passion of childish
vanity, self-love <i>in excelsis</i>, and no more.&nbsp; It is to
be understood that I have been painting chaos and describing the
inarticulate.&nbsp; Every lineament that appears is too precise,
almost every word used too strong.&nbsp; Take a finger-post in
the mountains on a day of rolling mists; I have but copied the
names that appear upon the pointers, the names of definite and
famous cities far distant, and now perhaps basking in sunshine;
but Christina remained all these hours, as it were, at the foot
of the post itself, not moving, and enveloped in mutable and
blinding wreaths of haze.</p>
<p>The day was growing late and the sunbeams long and level, when
she sat suddenly up, and wrapped in its handkerchief and put by
that psalm-book which had already played a part so decisive in
the first chapter of her love-story.&nbsp; In the absence of the
mesmerist’s eye, we are told nowadays that the head of a
bright nail may fill his place, if it be steadfastly
regarded.&nbsp; So that torn page had riveted her attention on
what might else have been but little, and perhaps soon forgotten;
while the ominous words of Dandie—heard, not heeded, and
still remembered—had lent to her thoughts, or rather to her
mood, a cast of solemnity, and that idea of Fate—a pagan
Fate, uncontrolled by any Christian deity, obscure, lawless, and
august—moving indissuadably in the affairs of Christian
men.&nbsp; Thus even that phenomenon of love at first sight,
which is so rare and seems so simple and violent, like a
disruption of life’s tissue, may be decomposed into a
sequence of accidents happily concurring.</p>
<p>She put on a grey frock and a pink kerchief, looked at herself
a moment with approval in the small square of glass that served
her for a toilet mirror, and went softly downstairs through the
sleeping house that resounded with the sound of afternoon
snoring.&nbsp; Just outside the door, Dandie was sitting with a
book in his hand, not reading, only honouring the Sabbath by a
sacred vacancy of mind.&nbsp; She came near him and stood
still.</p>
<p>“I’m for off up the muirs, Dandie,” she
said.</p>
<p>There was something unusually soft in her tones that made him
look up.&nbsp; She was pale, her eyes dark and bright; no trace
remained of the levity of the morning.</p>
<p>“Ay, lass?&nbsp; Ye’ll have yer ups and downs like
me, I’m thinkin’,” he observed.</p>
<p>“What for do ye say that?” she asked.</p>
<p>“O, for naething,” says Dand.&nbsp; “Only I
think ye’re mair like me than the lave of them.&nbsp;
Ye’ve mair of the poetic temper, tho’ Guid kens
little enough of the poetic taalent.&nbsp; It’s an ill gift
at the best.&nbsp; Look at yoursel’.&nbsp; At denner you
were all sunshine and flowers and laughter, and now you’re
like the star of evening on a lake.”</p>
<p>She drank in this hackneyed compliment like wine, and it
glowed in her veins.</p>
<p>“But I’m saying, Dand”—she came nearer
him—“I’m for the muirs.&nbsp; I must have a
braith of air.&nbsp; If Clem was to be speiring for me, try and
quaiet him, will ye no?”</p>
<p>“What way?” said Dandie.&nbsp; “I ken but
the ae way, and that’s leein’.&nbsp; I’ll say
ye had a sair heid, if ye like.”</p>
<p>“But I havena,” she objected.</p>
<p>“I daursay no,” he returned.&nbsp; “I said I
would say ye had; and if ye like to nay-say me when ye come back,
it’ll no mateerially maitter, for my
chara’ter’s clean gane a’ready past
reca’.”</p>
<p>“O, Dand, are ye a lecar?” she asked,
lingering.</p>
<p>“Folks say sae,” replied the bard.</p>
<p>“Wha says sae?” she pursued.</p>
<p>“Them that should ken the best,” he
responded.&nbsp; “The lassies, for ane.”</p>
<p>“But, Dand, you would never lee to me?” she
asked.</p>
<p>“I’ll leave that for your pairt of it, ye
girzie,” said he.&nbsp; “Ye’ll lee to me fast
eneuch, when ye hae gotten a jo.&nbsp; I’m tellin’ ye
and it’s true; when you have a jo, Miss Kirstie,
it’ll be for guid and ill.&nbsp; I ken: I was made that way
mysel’, but the deil was in my luck!&nbsp; Here, gang awa
wi’ ye to your muirs, and let me be; I’m in an hour
of inspiraution, ye upsetting tawpie!”</p>
<p>But she clung to her brother’s neighbourhood, she knew
not why.</p>
<p>“Will ye no gie’s a kiss, Dand?” she
said.&nbsp; “I aye likit ye fine.”</p>
<p>He kissed her and considered her a moment; he found something
strange in her.&nbsp; But he was a libertine through and through,
nourished equal contempt and suspicion of all womankind, and paid
his way among them habitually with idle compliments.</p>
<p>“Gae wa’ wi’ ye!” said he.&nbsp;
“Ye’re a dentie baby, and be content wi’
that!”</p>
<p>That was Dandie’s way; a kiss and a comfit to
Jenny—a bawbee and my blessing to Jill—and goodnight
to the whole clan of ye, my dears! When anything approached the
serious, it became a matter for men, he both thought and
said.&nbsp; Women, when they did not absorb, were only children
to be shoo’d away.&nbsp; Merely in his character of
connoisseur, however, Dandie glanced carelessly after his sister
as she crossed the meadow.&nbsp; “The brat’s no that
bad!” he thought with surprise, for though he had just been
paying her compliments, he had not really looked at her.&nbsp;
“Hey! what’s yon?”&nbsp; For the grey dress was
cut with short sleeves and skirts, and displayed her trim strong
legs clad in pink stockings of the same shade as the kerchief she
wore round her shoulders, and that shimmered as she went.&nbsp;
This was not her way in undress; he knew her ways and the ways of
the whole sex in the country-side, no one better; when they did
not go barefoot, they wore stout “rig and furrow”
woollen hose of an invisible blue mostly, when they were not
black outright; and Dandie, at sight of this daintiness, put two
and two together.&nbsp; It was a silk handkerchief, then they
would be silken hose; they matched—then the whole outfit
was a present of Clem’s, a costly present, and not
something to be worn through bog and briar, or on a late
afternoon of Sunday.&nbsp; He whistled.&nbsp; “My denty
May, either your heid’s fair turned, or there’s some
ongoings!” he observed, and dismissed the subject.</p>
<p>She went slowly at first, but ever straighter and faster for
the Cauldstaneslap, a pass among the hills to which the farm owed
its name.&nbsp; The Slap opened like a doorway between two
rounded hillocks; and through this ran the short cut to
Hermiston.&nbsp; Immediately on the other side it went down
through the Deil’s Hags, a considerable marshy hollow of
the hill tops, full of springs, and crouching junipers, and pools
where the black peat-water slumbered.&nbsp; There was no view
from here.&nbsp; A man might have sat upon the Praying
Weaver’s stone a half century, and seen none but the
Cauldstaneslap children twice in the twenty-four hours on their
way to the school and back again, an occasional shepherd, the
irruption of a clan of sheep, or the birds who haunted about the
springs, drinking and shrilly piping.&nbsp; So, when she had once
passed the Slap, Kirstie was received into seclusion.&nbsp; She
looked back a last time at the farm.&nbsp; It still lay deserted
except for the figure of Dandie, who was now seen to be
scribbling in his lap, the hour of expected inspiration having
come to him at last.&nbsp; Thence she passed rapidly through the
morass, and came to the farther end of it, where a sluggish burn
discharges, and the path for Hermiston accompanies it on the
beginning of its downward path.&nbsp; From this corner a wide
view was opened to her of the whole stretch of braes upon the
other side, still sallow and in places rusty with the winter,
with the path marked boldly, here and there by the burn-side a
tuft of birches, and—two miles off as the crow
flies—from its enclosures and young plantations, the
windows of Hermiston glittering in the western sun.</p>
<p>Here she sat down and waited, and looked for a long time at
these far-away bright panes of glass.&nbsp; It amused her to have
so extended a view, she thought.&nbsp; It amused her to see the
house of Hermiston—to see “folk”; and there was
an indistinguishable human unit, perhaps the gardener, visibly
sauntering on the gravel paths.</p>
<p>By the time the sun was down and all the easterly braes lay
plunged in clear shadow, she was aware of another figure coming
up the path at a most unequal rate of approach, now half running,
now pausing and seeming to hesitate.&nbsp; She watched him at
first with a total suspension of thought.&nbsp; She held her
thought as a person holds his breathing.&nbsp; Then she consented
to recognise him.&nbsp; “He’ll no be coming here, he
canna be; it’s no possible.”&nbsp; And there began to
grow upon her a subdued choking suspense.&nbsp; He <i>was</i>
coming; his hesitations had quite ceased, his step grew firm and
swift; no doubt remained; and the question loomed up before her
instant: what was she to do?&nbsp; It was all very well to say
that her brother was a laird himself: it was all very well to
speak of casual intermarriages and to count cousinship, like
Auntie Kirstie.&nbsp; The difference in their social station was
trenchant; propriety, prudence, all that she had ever learned,
all that she knew, bade her flee.&nbsp; But on the other hand the
cup of life now offered to her was too enchanting.&nbsp; For one
moment, she saw the question clearly, and definitely made her
choice.&nbsp; She stood up and showed herself an instant in the
gap relieved upon the sky line; and the next, fled trembling and
sat down glowing with excitement on the Weaver’s
stone.&nbsp; She shut her eyes, seeking, praying for
composure.&nbsp; Her hand shook in her lap, and her mind was full
of incongruous and futile speeches.&nbsp; What was there to make
a work about?&nbsp; She could take care of herself, she
supposed!&nbsp; There was no harm in seeing the laird.&nbsp; It
was the best thing that could happen.&nbsp; She would mark a
proper distance to him once and for all.&nbsp; Gradually the
wheels of her nature ceased to go round so madly, and she sat in
passive expectation, a quiet, solitary figure in the midst of the
grey moss.&nbsp; I have said she was no hypocrite, but here I am
at fault.&nbsp; She never admitted to herself that she had come
up the hill to look for Archie.&nbsp; And perhaps after all she
did not know, perhaps came as a stone falls.&nbsp; For the steps
of love in the young, and especially in girls, are instinctive
and unconscious.</p>
<p>In the meantime Archie was drawing rapidly near, and he at
least was consciously seeking her neighbourhood.&nbsp; The
afternoon had turned to ashes in his mouth; the memory of the
girl had kept him from reading and drawn him as with cords; and
at last, as the cool of the evening began to come on, he had
taken his hat and set forth, with a smothered ejaculation, by the
moor path to Cauldstaneslap.&nbsp; He had no hope to find her; he
took the off chance without expectation of result and to relieve
his uneasiness.&nbsp; The greater was his surprise, as he
surmounted the slope and came into the hollow of the Deil’s
Hags, to see there, like an answer to his wishes, the little
womanly figure in the grey dress and the pink kerchief sitting
little, and low, and lost, and acutely solitary, in these
desolate surroundings and on the weather-beaten stone of the dead
weaver.&nbsp; Those things that still smacked of winter were all
rusty about her, and those things that already relished of the
spring had put forth the tender and lively colours of the
season.&nbsp; Even in the unchanging face of the death-stone,
changes were to be remarked; and in the channeled lettering, the
moss began to renew itself in jewels of green.&nbsp; By an
afterthought that was a stroke of art, she had turned up over her
head the back of the kerchief; so that it now framed becomingly
her vivacious and yet pensive face.&nbsp; Her feet were gathered
under her on the one side, and she leaned on her bare arm, which
showed out strong and round, tapered to a slim wrist, and
shimmered in the fading light.</p>
<p>Young Hermiston was struck with a certain chill.&nbsp; He was
reminded that he now dealt in serious matters of life and
death.&nbsp; This was a grown woman he was approaching, endowed
with her mysterious potencies and attractions, the treasury of
the continued race, and he was neither better nor worse than the
average of his sex and age.&nbsp; He had a certain delicacy which
had preserved him hitherto unspotted, and which (had either of
them guessed it) made him a more dangerous companion when his
heart should be really stirred.&nbsp; His throat was dry as he
came near; but the appealing sweetness of her smile stood between
them like a guardian angel.</p>
<p>For she turned to him and smiled, though without rising.&nbsp;
There was a shade in this cavalier greeting that neither of them
perceived; neither he, who simply thought it gracious and
charming as herself; nor yet she, who did not observe (quick as
she was) the difference between rising to meet the laird, and
remaining seated to receive the expected admirer.</p>
<p>“Are ye stepping west, Hermiston?” said she,
giving him his territorial name after the fashion of the
country-side.</p>
<p>“I was,” said he, a little hoarsely, “but I
think I will be about the end of my stroll now.&nbsp; Are you
like me, Miss Christina?&nbsp; The house would not hold me.&nbsp;
I came here seeking air.”</p>
<p>He took his seat at the other end of the tombstone and studied
her, wondering what was she.&nbsp; There was infinite import in
the question alike for her and him.</p>
<p>“Ay,” she said.&nbsp; “I couldna bear the
roof either.&nbsp; It’s a habit of mine to come up here
about the gloaming when it’s quaiet and caller.”</p>
<p>“It was a habit of my mother’s also,” he
said gravely.&nbsp; The recollection half startled him as he
expressed it.&nbsp; He looked around.&nbsp; “I have scarce
been here since.&nbsp; It’s peaceful,” he said, with
a long breath.</p>
<p>“It’s no like Glasgow,” she replied.&nbsp;
“A weary place, yon Glasgow!&nbsp; But what a day have I
had for my homecoming, and what a bonny evening!”</p>
<p>“Indeed, it was a wonderful day,” said
Archie.&nbsp; “I think I will remember it years and years
until I come to die.&nbsp; On days like this—I do not know
if you feel as I do—but everything appears so brief, and
fragile, and exquisite, that I am afraid to touch life.&nbsp; We
are here for so short a time; and all the old people before
us—Rutherfords of Hermiston, Elliotts of the
Cauldstaneslap—that were here but a while since riding
about and keeping up a great noise in this quiet
corner—making love too, and marrying—why, where are
they now?&nbsp; It’s deadly commonplace, but, after all,
the commonplaces are the great poetic truths.”</p>
<p>He was sounding her, semi-consciously, to see if she could
understand him; to learn if she were only an animal the colour of
flowers, or had a soul in her to keep her sweet.&nbsp; She, on
her part, her means well in hand, watched, womanlike, for any
opportunity to shine, to abound in his humour, whatever that
might be.&nbsp; The dramatic artist, that lies dormant or only
half awake in most human beings, had in her sprung to his feet in
a divine fury, and chance had served her well.&nbsp; She looked
upon him with a subdued twilight look that became the hour of the
day and the train of thought; earnestness shone through her like
stars in the purple west; and from the great but controlled
upheaval of her whole nature there passed into her voice, and
rang in her lightest words, a thrill of emotion.</p>
<p>“Have you mind of Dand’s song?” she
answered.&nbsp; “I think he’ll have been trying to
say what you have been thinking.”</p>
<p>“No, I never heard it,” he said.&nbsp;
“Repeat it to me, can you?”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing wanting the tune,” said
Kirstie.</p>
<p>“Then sing it me,” said he.</p>
<p>“On the Lord’s Day?&nbsp; That would never do, Mr.
Weir!”</p>
<p>“I am afraid I am not so strict a keeper of the Sabbath,
and there is no one in this place to hear us, unless the poor old
ancient under the stone.”</p>
<p>“No that I’m thinking that really,” she
said.&nbsp; “By my way of thinking, it’s just as
serious as a psalm.&nbsp; Will I sooth it to ye, then?”</p>
<p>“If you please,” said he, and, drawing near to her
on the tombstone, prepared to listen.</p>
<p>She sat up as if to sing.&nbsp; “I’ll only can
sooth it to ye,” she explained.&nbsp; “I wouldna like
to sing out loud on the Sabbath.&nbsp; I think the birds would
carry news of it to Gilbert,” and she smiled.&nbsp;
“It’s about the Elliotts,” she continued,
“and I think there’s few bonnier bits in the
book-poets, though Dand has never got printed yet.”</p>
<p>And she began, in the low, clear tones of her half voice, now
sinking almost to a whisper, now rising to a particular note
which was her best, and which Archie learned to wait for with
growing emotion:—</p>
<blockquote><p>“O they rade in the rain, in the days that
are gane,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the rain and the wind and the lave,<br>
They shoutit in the ha’ and they routit on the hill,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; But they’re a’ quaitit noo in the
grave.<br>
Auld, auld Elliotts, clay-cauld Elliotts, dour, bauld Elliotte of
auld!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All the time she sang she looked steadfastly before her, her
knees straight, her hands upon her knee, her head cast back and
up.&nbsp; The expression was admirable throughout, for had she
not learned it from the lips and under the criticism of the
author?&nbsp; When it was done, she turned upon Archie a face
softly bright, and eyes gently suffused and shining in the
twilight, and his heart rose and went out to her with boundless
pity and sympathy.&nbsp; His question was answered.&nbsp; She was
a human being tuned to a sense of the tragedy of life; there were
pathos and music and a great heart in the girl.</p>
<p>He arose instinctively, she also; for she saw she had gained a
point, and scored the impression deeper, and she had wit enough
left to flee upon a victory.&nbsp; They were but commonplaces
that remained to be exchanged, but the low, moved voices in which
they passed made them sacred in the memory.&nbsp; In the falling
greyness of the evening he watched her figure winding through the
morass, saw it turn a last time and wave a hand, and then pass
through the Slap; and it seemed to him as if something went along
with her out of the deepest of his heart.&nbsp; And something
surely had come, and come to dwell there.&nbsp; He had retained
from childhood a picture, now half obliterated by the passage of
time and the multitude of fresh impressions, of his mother
telling him, with the fluttered earnestness of her voice, and
often with dropping tears, the tale of the “Praying
Weaver,” on the very scene of his brief tragedy and long
repose.&nbsp; And now there was a companion piece; and he beheld,
and he should behold for ever, Christina perched on the same
tomb, in the grey colours of the evening, gracious, dainty,
perfect as a flower, and she also singing—</p>
<blockquote><p>“Of old, unhappy far off things,<br>
And battles long ago,”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>of their common ancestors now dead, of their rude wars
composed, their weapons buried with them, and of these strange
changelings, their descendants, who lingered a little in their
places, and would soon be gone also, and perhaps sung of by
others at the gloaming hour.&nbsp; By one of the unconscious arts
of tenderness the two women were enshrined together in his
memory.&nbsp; Tears, in that hour of sensibility, came into his
eyes indifferently at the thought of either; and the girl, from
being something merely bright and shapely, was caught up into the
zone of things serious as life and death and his dead
mother.&nbsp; So that in all ways and on either side, Fate played
his game artfully with this poor pair of children.&nbsp; The
generations were prepared, the pangs were made ready, before the
curtain rose on the dark drama.</p>
<p>In the same moment of time that she disappeared from Archie,
there opened before Kirstie’s eyes the cup-like hollow in
which the farm lay.&nbsp; She saw, some five hundred feet below
her, the house making itself bright with candles, and this was a
broad hint to her to hurry.&nbsp; For they were only kindled on a
Sabbath night with a view to that family worship which rounded in
the incomparable tedium of the day and brought on the relaxation
of supper.&nbsp; Already she knew that Robert must be
within-sides at the head of the table, “waling the
portions”; for it was Robert in his quality of family
priest and judge, not the gifted Gilbert, who officiated.&nbsp;
She made good time accordingly down the steep ascent, and came up
to the door panting as the three younger brothers, all roused at
last from slumber, stood together in the cool and the dark of the
evening with a fry of nephews and nieces about them, chatting and
awaiting the expected signal.&nbsp; She stood back; she had no
mind to direct attention to her late arrival or to her labouring
breath.</p>
<p>“Kirstie, ye have shaved it this time, my lass?”
said Clem.&nbsp; “Whaur were ye?”</p>
<p>“O, just taking a dander by mysel’,” said
Kirstie.</p>
<p>And the talk continued on the subject of the American War,
without further reference to the truant who stood by them in the
covert of the dusk, thrilling with happiness and the sense of
guilt.</p>
<p>The signal was given, and the brothers began to go in one
after another, amid the jostle and throng of Hob’s
children.</p>
<p>Only Dandie, waiting till the last, caught Kirstie by the
arm.&nbsp; “When did ye begin to dander in pink hosen,
Mistress Elliott?” he whispered slyly.</p>
<p>She looked down; she was one blush.&nbsp; “I maun have
forgotten to change them,” said she; and went into prayers
in her turn with a troubled mind, between anxiety as to whether
Dand should have observed her yellow stockings at church, and
should thus detect her in a palpable falsehood, and shame that
she had already made good his prophecy.&nbsp; She remembered the
words of it, how it was to be when she had gotten a jo, and that
that would be for good and evil.&nbsp; “Will I have gotten
my jo now?” she thought with a secret rapture.</p>
<p>And all through prayers, where it was her principal business
to conceal the pink stockings from the eyes of the indifferent
Mrs. Hob—and all through supper, as she made a feint of
eating and sat at the table radiant and constrained—and
again when she had left them and come into her chamber, and was
alone with her sleeping niece, and could at last lay aside the
armour of society—the same words sounded within her, the
same profound note of happiness, of a world all changed and
renewed, of a day that had been passed in Paradise, and of a
night that was to be heaven opened.&nbsp; All night she seemed to
be conveyed smoothly upon a shallow stream of sleep and waking,
and through the bowers of Beulah; all night she cherished to her
heart that exquisite hope; and if, towards morning, she forgot it
a while in a more profound unconsciousness, it was to catch again
the rainbow thought with her first moment of awaking.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII—ENTER MEPHISTOPHELES</h2>
<p>Two days later a gig from Crossmichael deposited Frank Innes
at the doors of Hermiston.&nbsp; Once in a way, during the past
winter, Archie, in some acute phase of boredom, had written him a
letter.&nbsp; It had contained something in the nature of an
invitation or a reference to an invitation—precisely what,
neither of them now remembered.&nbsp; When Innes had received it,
there had been nothing further from his mind than to bury himself
in the moors with Archie; but not even the most acute political
heads are guided through the steps of life with unerring
directness.&nbsp; That would require a gift of prophecy which has
been denied to man.&nbsp; For instance, who could have imagined
that, not a month after he had received the letter, and turned it
into mockery, and put off answering it, and in the end lost it,
misfortunes of a gloomy cast should begin to thicken over
Frank’s career?&nbsp; His case may be briefly stated.&nbsp;
His father, a small Morayshire laird with a large family, became
recalcitrant and cut off the supplies; he had fitted himself out
with the beginnings of quite a good law library, which, upon some
sudden losses on the turf, he had been obliged to sell before
they were paid for; and his bookseller, hearing some rumour of
the event, took out a warrant for his arrest.&nbsp; Innes had
early word of it, and was able to take precautions.&nbsp; In this
immediate welter of his affairs, with an unpleasant charge
hanging over him, he had judged it the part of prudence to be off
instantly, had written a fervid letter to his father at
Inverauld, and put himself in the coach for Crossmichael.&nbsp;
Any port in a storm!&nbsp; He was manfully turning his back on
the Parliament House and its gay babble, on porter and oysters,
the race-course and the ring; and manfully prepared, until these
clouds should have blown by, to share a living grave with Archie
Weir at Hermiston.</p>
<p>To do him justice, he was no less surprised to be going than
Archie was to see him come; and he carried off his wonder with an
infinitely better grace.</p>
<p>“Well, here I am!” said he, as he alighted.&nbsp;
“Pylades has come to Orestes at last.&nbsp; By the way, did
you get my answer?&nbsp; No?&nbsp; How very provoking!&nbsp;
Well, here I am to answer for myself, and that’s better
still.”</p>
<p>“I am very glad to see you, of course,” said
Archie.&nbsp; “I make you heartily welcome, of
course.&nbsp; But you surely have not come to stay, with the
Courts still sitting; is that not most unwise?”</p>
<p>“Damn the Courts!” says Frank.&nbsp; “What
are the Courts to friendship and a little fishing?”</p>
<p>And so it was agreed that he was to stay, with no term to the
visit but the term which he had privily set to it
himself—the day, namely, when his father should have come
down with the dust, and he should be able to pacify the
bookseller.&nbsp; On such vague conditions there began for these
two young men (who were not even friends) a life of great
familiarity and, as the days drew on, less and less
intimacy.&nbsp; They were together at meal times, together
o’ nights when the hour had come for whisky-toddy; but it
might have been noticed (had there been any one to pay heed) that
they were rarely so much together by day.&nbsp; Archie had
Hermiston to attend to, multifarious activities in the hills, in
which he did not require, and had even refused, Frank’s
escort.&nbsp; He would be off sometimes in the morning and leave
only a note on the breakfast table to announce the fact; and
sometimes, with no notice at all, he would not return for dinner
until the hour was long past.&nbsp; Innes groaned under these
desertions; it required all his philosophy to sit down to a
solitary breakfast with composure, and all his unaffected
good-nature to be able to greet Archie with friendliness on the
more rare occasions when he came home late for dinner.</p>
<p>“I wonder what on earth he finds to do, Mrs.
Elliott?” said he one morning, after he had just read the
hasty billet and sat down to table.</p>
<p>“I suppose it will be business, sir,” replied the
housekeeper drily, measuring his distance off to him by an
indicated curtsy.</p>
<p>“But I can’t imagine what business!” he
reiterated.</p>
<p>“I suppose it will be <i>his</i> business,”
retorted the austere Kirstie.</p>
<p>He turned to her with that happy brightness that made the
charm of his disposition, and broke into a peal of healthy and
natural laughter.</p>
<p>“Well played, Mrs. Elliott!” he cried; and the
housekeeper’s face relaxed into the shadow of an iron
smile.&nbsp; “Well played indeed!” said he.&nbsp;
“But you must not be making a stranger of me like
that.&nbsp; Why, Archie and I were at the High School together,
and we’ve been to college together, and we were going to
the Bar together, when—you know!&nbsp; Dear, dear me! what
a pity that was!&nbsp; A life spoiled, a fine young fellow as
good as buried here in the wilderness with rustics; and all for
what?&nbsp; A frolic, silly, if you like, but no more.&nbsp; God,
how good your scones are, Mrs. Elliott!”</p>
<p>“They’re no mines, it was the lassie made
them,” said Kirstie; “and, saving your presence,
there’s little sense in taking the Lord’s name in
vain about idle vivers that you fill your kyte
wi’.”</p>
<p>“I daresay you’re perfectly right,
ma’am,” quoth the imperturbable Frank.&nbsp;
“But as I was saying, this is a pitiable business, this
about poor Archie; and you and I might do worse than put our
heads together, like a couple of sensible people, and bring it to
an end.&nbsp; Let me tell you, ma’am, that Archie is really
quite a promising young man, and in my opinion he would do well
at the Bar.&nbsp; As for his father, no one can deny his ability,
and I don’t fancy any one would care to deny that he has
the deil’s own temper—”</p>
<p>“If you’ll excuse me, Mr. Innes, I think the lass
is crying on me,” said Kirstie, and flounced from the
room.</p>
<p>“The damned, cross-grained, old broomstick!”
ejaculated Innes.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Kirstie had escaped into the kitchen, and
before her vassal gave vent to her feelings.</p>
<p>“Here, ettercap!&nbsp; Ye’ll have to wait on yon
Innes!&nbsp; I canna haud myself in.&nbsp; ‘Puir
Erchie!’&nbsp; I’d ‘puir Erchie’ him, if
I had my way!&nbsp; And Hermiston with the deil’s ain
temper!&nbsp; God, let him take Hermiston’s scones out of
his mouth first.&nbsp; There’s no a hair on ayther o’
the Weirs that hasna mair spunk and dirdum to it than what he has
in his hale dwaibly body!&nbsp; Settin’ up his snash to
me!&nbsp; Let him gang to the black toon where he’s mebbe
wantit—birling in a curricle—wi’ pimatum on his
heid—making a mess o’ himsel’ wi’ nesty
hizzies—a fair disgrace!”&nbsp; It was impossible to
hear without admiration Kirstie’s graduated disgust, as she
brought forth, one after another, these somewhat baseless
charges.&nbsp; Then she remembered her immediate purpose, and
turned again on her fascinated auditor.&nbsp; “Do ye no
hear me, tawpie? Do ye no hear what I’m tellin’
ye?&nbsp; Will I have to shoo ye in to him? If I come to attend
to ye, mistress!” And the maid fled the kitchen, which had
become practically dangerous, to attend on Innes’ wants in
the front parlour.</p>
<p><i>Tantaene irae</i>?&nbsp; Has the reader perceived the
reason?&nbsp; Since Frank’s coming there were no more hours
of gossip over the supper tray!&nbsp; All his blandishments were
in vain; he had started handicapped on the race for Mrs.
Elliott’s favour.</p>
<p>But it was a strange thing how misfortune dogged him in his
efforts to be genial.&nbsp; I must guard the reader against
accepting Kirstie’s epithets as evidence; she was more
concerned for their vigour than for their accuracy.&nbsp;
Dwaibly, for instance; nothing could be more calumnious.&nbsp;
Frank was the very picture of good looks, good humour, and manly
youth.&nbsp; He had bright eyes with a sparkle and a dance to
them, curly hair, a charming smile, brilliant teeth, an admirable
carriage of the head, the look of a gentleman, the address of one
accustomed to please at first sight and to improve the
impression.&nbsp; And with all these advantages, he failed with
every one about Hermiston; with the silent shepherd, with the
obsequious grieve, with the groom who was also the ploughman,
with the gardener and the gardener’s sister—a pious,
down-hearted woman with a shawl over her ears—he failed
equally and flatly.&nbsp; They did not like him, and they showed
it.&nbsp; The little maid, indeed, was an exception; she admired
him devoutly, probably dreamed of him in her private hours; but
she was accustomed to play the part of silent auditor to
Kirstie’s tirades and silent recipient of Kirstie’s
buffets, and she had learned not only to be a very capable girl
of her years, but a very secret and prudent one besides.&nbsp;
Frank was thus conscious that he had one ally and sympathiser in
the midst of that general union of disfavour that surrounded,
watched, and waited on him in the house of Hermiston; but he had
little comfort or society from that alliance, and the demure
little maid (twelve on her last birthday) preserved her own
counsel, and tripped on his service, brisk, dumbly responsive,
but inexorably unconversational.&nbsp; For the others, they were
beyond hope and beyond endurance.&nbsp; Never had a young Apollo
been cast among such rustic barbarians.&nbsp; But perhaps the
cause of his ill-success lay in one trait which was habitual and
unconscious with him, yet diagnostic of the man.&nbsp; It was his
practice to approach any one person at the expense of some one
else.&nbsp; He offered you an alliance against the some one else;
he flattered you by slighting him; you were drawn into a small
intrigue against him before you knew how.&nbsp; Wonderful are the
virtues of this process generally; but Frank’s mistake was
in the choice of the some one else.&nbsp; He was not politic in
that; he listened to the voice of irritation.&nbsp; Archie had
offended him at first by what he had felt to be rather a dry
reception, had offended him since by his frequent absences.&nbsp;
He was besides the one figure continually present in
Frank’s eye; and it was to his immediate dependants that
Frank could offer the snare of his sympathy.&nbsp; Now the truth
is that the Weirs, father and son, were surrounded by a posse of
strenuous loyalists.&nbsp; Of my lord they were vastly
proud.&nbsp; It was a distinction in itself to be one of the
vassals of the “Hanging Judge,” and his gross,
formidable joviality was far from unpopular in the neighbourhood
of his home.&nbsp; For Archie they had, one and all, a sensitive
affection and respect which recoiled from a word of
belittlement.</p>
<p>Nor was Frank more successful when he went farther
afield.&nbsp; To the Four Black Brothers, for instance, he was
antipathetic in the highest degree.&nbsp; Hob thought him too
light, Gib too profane.&nbsp; Clem, who saw him but for a day or
two before he went to Glasgow, wanted to know what the
fule’s business was, and whether he meant to stay here all
session time! “Yon’s a drone,” he
pronounced.&nbsp; As for Dand, it will be enough to describe
their first meeting, when Frank had been whipping a river and the
rustic celebrity chanced to come along the path.</p>
<p>“I’m told you’re quite a poet,” Frank
had said.</p>
<p>“Wha tell’t ye that, mannie?” had been the
unconciliating answer.</p>
<p>“O, everybody!” says Frank.</p>
<p>“God!&nbsp; Here’s fame!” said the sardonic
poet, and he had passed on his way.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, we have here perhaps a truer explanation
of Frank’s failures.&nbsp; Had he met Mr. Sheriff Scott he
could have turned a neater compliment, because Mr. Scott would
have been a friend worth making.&nbsp; Dand, on the other hand,
he did not value sixpence, and he showed it even while he tried
to flatter.&nbsp; Condescension is an excellent thing, but it is
strange how one-sided the pleasure of it is!&nbsp; He who goes
fishing among the Scots peasantry with condescension for a bait
will have an empty basket by evening.</p>
<p>In proof of this theory Frank made a great success of it at
the Crossmichael Club, to which Archie took him immediately on
his arrival; his own last appearance on that scene of
gaiety.&nbsp; Frank was made welcome there at once, continued to
go regularly, and had attended a meeting (as the members ever
after loved to tell) on the evening before his death.&nbsp; Young
Hay and young Pringle appeared again.&nbsp; There was another
supper at Windiclaws, another dinner at Driffel; and it resulted
in Frank being taken to the bosom of the county people as
unreservedly as he had been repudiated by the country folk.&nbsp;
He occupied Hermiston after the manner of an invader in a
conquered capital.&nbsp; He was perpetually issuing from it, as
from a base, to toddy parties, fishing parties, and dinner
parties, to which Archie was not invited, or to which Archie
would not go.&nbsp; It was now that the name of The Recluse
became general for the young man.&nbsp; Some say that Innes
invented it; Innes, at least, spread it abroad.</p>
<p>“How’s all with your Recluse to-day?” people
would ask.</p>
<p>“O, reclusing away!” Innes would declare, with his
bright air of saying something witty; and immediately interrupt
the general laughter which he had provoked much more by his air
than his words, “Mind you, it’s all very well
laughing, but I’m not very well pleased.&nbsp; Poor Archie
is a good fellow, an excellent fellow, a fellow I always
liked.&nbsp; I think it small of him to take his little disgrace
so hard, and shut himself up.&nbsp; ‘Grant that it is a
ridiculous story, painfully ridiculous,’ I keep telling
him.&nbsp; ‘Be a man!&nbsp; Live it down, man!’&nbsp;
But not he.&nbsp; Of course, it’s just solitude, and shame,
and all that.&nbsp; But I confess I’m beginning to fear the
result.&nbsp; It would be all the pities in the world if a really
promising fellow like Weir was to end ill.&nbsp; I’m
seriously tempted to write to Lord Hermiston, and put it plainly
to him.”</p>
<p>“I would if I were you,” some of his auditors
would say, shaking the head, sitting bewildered and confused at
this new view of the matter, so deftly indicated by a single
word.&nbsp; “A capital idea!” they would add, and
wonder at the <i>aplomb</i> and position of this young man, who
talked as a matter of course of writing to Hermiston and
correcting him upon his private affairs.</p>
<p>And Frank would proceed, sweetly confidential:
“I’ll give you an idea, now.&nbsp; He’s
actually sore about the way that I’m received and
he’s left out in the county—actually jealous and
sore.&nbsp; I’ve rallied him and I’ve reasoned with
him, told him that every one was most kindly inclined towards
him, told him even that I was received merely because I was his
guest.&nbsp; But it’s no use.&nbsp; He will neither accept
the invitations he gets, nor stop brooding about the ones where
he’s left out.&nbsp; What I’m afraid of is that the
wound’s ulcerating.&nbsp; He had always one of those dark,
secret, angry natures—a little underhand and plenty of
bile—you know the sort.&nbsp; He must have inherited it
from the Weirs, whom I suspect to have been a worthy family of
weavers somewhere; what’s the cant phrase?—sedentary
occupation.&nbsp; It’s precisely the kind of character to
go wrong in a false position like what his father’s made
for him, or he’s making for himself, whichever you like to
call it.&nbsp; And for my part, I think it a disgrace,”
Frank would say generously.</p>
<p>Presently the sorrow and anxiety of this disinterested friend
took shape.&nbsp; He began in private, in conversations of two,
to talk vaguely of bad habits and low habits.&nbsp; “I must
say I’m afraid he’s going wrong altogether,” he
would say.&nbsp; “I’ll tell you plainly, and between
ourselves, I scarcely like to stay there any longer; only, man,
I’m positively afraid to leave him alone.&nbsp;
You’ll see, I shall be blamed for it later on.&nbsp;
I’m staying at a great sacrifice.&nbsp; I’m hindering
my chances at the Bar, and I can’t blind my eyes to
it.&nbsp; And what I’m afraid of is that I’m going to
get kicked for it all round before all’s done.&nbsp; You
see, nobody believes in friendship nowadays.”</p>
<p>“Well, Innes,” his interlocutor would reply,
“it’s very good of you, I must say that.&nbsp; If
there’s any blame going, you’ll always be sure of
<i>my</i> good word, for one thing.”</p>
<p>“Well,” Frank would continue, “candidly, I
don’t say it’s pleasant.&nbsp; He has a very rough
way with him; his father’s son, you know.&nbsp; I
don’t say he’s rude—of course, I couldn’t
be expected to stand that—but he steers very near the
wind.&nbsp; No, it’s not pleasant; but I tell ye, man, in
conscience I don’t think it would be fair to leave
him.&nbsp; Mind you, I don’t say there’s anything
actually wrong.&nbsp; What I say is that I don’t like the
looks of it, man!” and he would press the arm of his
momentary confidant.</p>
<p>In the early stages I am persuaded there was no malice.&nbsp;
He talked but for the pleasure of airing himself.&nbsp; He was
essentially glib, as becomes the young advocate, and essentially
careless of the truth, which is the mark of the young ass; and so
he talked at random.&nbsp; There was no particular bias, but that
one which is indigenous and universal, to flatter himself and to
please and interest the present friend.&nbsp; And by thus milling
air out of his mouth, he had presently built up a presentation of
Archie which was known and talked of in all corners of the
county.&nbsp; Wherever there was a residential house and a walled
garden, wherever there was a dwarfish castle and a park, wherever
a quadruple cottage by the ruins of a peel-tower showed an old
family going down, and wherever a handsome villa with a carriage
approach and a shrubbery marked the coming up of a new
one—probably on the wheels of machinery—Archie began
to be regarded in the light of a dark, perhaps a vicious mystery,
and the future developments of his career to be looked for with
uneasiness and confidential whispering.&nbsp; He had done
something disgraceful, my dear.&nbsp; What, was not precisely
known, and that good kind young man, Mr. Innes, did his best to
make light of it.&nbsp; But there it was.&nbsp; And Mr. Innes was
very anxious about him now; he was really uneasy, my dear; he was
positively wrecking his own prospects because he dared not leave
him alone.&nbsp; How wholly we all lie at the mercy of a single
prater, not needfully with any malign purpose!&nbsp; And if a man
but talks of himself in the right spirit, refers to his virtuous
actions by the way, and never applies to them the name of virtue,
how easily his evidence is accepted in the court of public
opinion!</p>
<p>All this while, however, there was a more poisonous ferment at
work between the two lads, which came late indeed to the surface,
but had modified and magnified their dissensions from the
first.&nbsp; To an idle, shallow, easy-going customer like Frank,
the smell of a mystery was attractive.&nbsp; It gave his mind
something to play with, like a new toy to a child; and it took
him on the weak side, for like many young men coming to the Bar,
and before they had been tried and found wanting, he flattered
himself he was a fellow of unusual quickness and
penetration.&nbsp; They knew nothing of Sherlock Holmes in those
days, but there was a good deal said of Talleyrand.&nbsp; And if
you could have caught Frank off his guard, he would have
confessed with a smirk that, if he resembled any one, it was the
Marquis de Talleyrand-Perigord.&nbsp; It was on the occasion of
Archie’s first absence that this interest took root.&nbsp;
It was vastly deepened when Kirstie resented his curiosity at
breakfast, and that same afternoon there occurred another scene
which clinched the business.&nbsp; He was fishing Swingleburn,
Archie accompanying him, when the latter looked at his watch.</p>
<p>“Well, good-bye,” said he.&nbsp; “I have
something to do.&nbsp; See you at dinner.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be in such a hurry,” cries
Frank.&nbsp; “Hold on till I get my rod up.&nbsp;
I’ll go with you; I’m sick of flogging this
ditch.”</p>
<p>And he began to reel up his line.</p>
<p>Archie stood speechless.&nbsp; He took a long while to recover
his wits under this direct attack; but by the time he was ready
with his answer, and the angle was almost packed up, he had
become completely Weir, and the hanging face gloomed on his young
shoulders.&nbsp; He spoke with a laboured composure, a laboured
kindness even; but a child could see that his mind was made
up.</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon, Innes; I don’t want to be
disagreeable, but let us understand one another from the
beginning.&nbsp; When I want your company, I’ll let you
know.”</p>
<p>“O!” cries Frank, “you don’t want my
company, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Apparently not just now,” replied Archie.&nbsp;
“I even indicated to you when I did, if you’ll
remember—and that was at dinner.&nbsp; If we two fellows
are to live together pleasantly—and I see no reason why we
should not—it can only be by respecting each other’s
privacy.&nbsp; If we begin intruding—”</p>
<p>“O, come!&nbsp; I’ll take this at no man’s
hands.&nbsp; Is this the way you treat a guest and an old
friend?” cried Innes.</p>
<p>“Just go home and think over what I said by
yourself,” continued Archie, “whether it’s
reasonable, or whether it’s really offensive or not; and
let’s meet at dinner as though nothing had happened,
I’ll put it this way, if you like—that I know my own
character, that I’m looking forward (with great pleasure, I
assure you) to a long visit from you, and that I’m taking
precautions at the first.&nbsp; I see the thing that
we—that I, if you like—might fall out upon, and I
step in and <i>obsto principiis</i>.&nbsp; I wager you five
pounds you’ll end by seeing that I mean friendliness, and I
assure you, Francie, I do,” he added, relenting.</p>
<p>Bursting with anger, but incapable of speech, Innes shouldered
his rod, made a gesture of farewell, and strode off down the
burn-side.&nbsp; Archie watched him go without moving.&nbsp; He
was sorry, but quite unashamed.&nbsp; He hated to be
inhospitable, but in one thing he was his father’s
son.&nbsp; He had a strong sense that his house was his own and
no man else’s; and to lie at a guest’s mercy was what
he refused.&nbsp; He hated to seem harsh.&nbsp; But that was
Frank’s lookout.&nbsp; If Frank had been commonly discreet,
he would have been decently courteous.&nbsp; And there was
another consideration.&nbsp; The secret he was protecting was not
his own merely; it was hers: it belonged to that inexpressible
she who was fast taking possession of his soul, and whom he would
soon have defended at the cost of burning cities.&nbsp; By the
time he had watched Frank as far as the Swingleburn-foot,
appearing and disappearing in the tarnished heather, still
stalking at a fierce gait but already dwindled in the distance
into less than the smallness of Lilliput, he could afford to
smile at the occurrence.&nbsp; Either Frank would go, and that
would be a relief—or he would continue to stay, and his
host must continue to endure him.&nbsp; And Archie was now
free—by devious paths, behind hillocks and in the hollow of
burns—to make for the trysting-place where Kirstie, cried
about by the curlew and the plover, waited and burned for his
coming by the Covenanter’s stone.</p>
<p>Innes went off down-hill in a passion of resentment, easy to
be understood, but which yielded progressively to the needs of
his situation.&nbsp; He cursed Archie for a cold-hearted,
unfriendly, rude, rude dog; and himself still more passionately
for a fool in having come to Hermiston when he might have sought
refuge in almost any other house in Scotland.&nbsp; But the step
once taken, was practically irretrievable.&nbsp; He had no more
ready money to go anywhere else; he would have to borrow from
Archie the next club-night; and ill as he thought of his
host’s manners, he was sure of his practical
generosity.&nbsp; Frank’s resemblance to Talleyrand strikes
me as imaginary; but at least not Talleyrand himself could have
more obediently taken his lesson from the facts.&nbsp; He met
Archie at dinner without resentment, almost with
cordiality.&nbsp; You must take your friends as you find them, he
would have said.&nbsp; Archie couldn’t help being his
father’s son, or his grandfather’s, the hypothetical
weaver’s, grandson.&nbsp; The son of a hunks, he was still
a hunks at heart, incapable of true generosity and consideration;
but he had other qualities with which Frank could divert himself
in the meanwhile, and to enjoy which it was necessary that Frank
should keep his temper.</p>
<p>So excellently was it controlled that he awoke next morning
with his head full of a different, though a cognate
subject.&nbsp; What was Archie’s little game?&nbsp; Why did
he shun Frank’s company?&nbsp; What was he keeping
secret?&nbsp; Was he keeping tryst with somebody, and was it a
woman?&nbsp; It would be a good joke and a fair revenge to
discover.&nbsp; To that task he set himself with a great deal of
patience, which might have surprised his friends, for he had been
always credited not with patience so much as brilliancy; and
little by little, from one point to another, he at last succeeded
in piecing out the situation.&nbsp; First he remarked that,
although Archie set out in all the directions of the compass, he
always came home again from some point between the south and
west.&nbsp; From the study of a map, and in consideration of the
great expanse of untenanted moorland running in that direction
towards the sources of the Clyde, he laid his finger on
Cauldstaneslap and two other neighbouring farms, Kingsmuirs and
Polintarf.&nbsp; But it was difficult to advance farther.&nbsp;
With his rod for a pretext, he vainly visited each of them in
turn; nothing was to be seen suspicious about this trinity of
moorland settlements.&nbsp; He would have tried to follow Archie,
had it been the least possible, but the nature of the land
precluded the idea.&nbsp; He did the next best, ensconced himself
in a quiet corner, and pursued his movements with a
telescope.&nbsp; It was equally in vain, and he soon wearied of
his futile vigilance, left the telescope at home, and had almost
given the matter up in despair, when, on the twenty-seventh day
of his visit, he was suddenly confronted with the person whom he
sought.&nbsp; The first Sunday Kirstie had managed to stay away
from kirk on some pretext of indisposition, which was more truly
modesty; the pleasure of beholding Archie seeming too sacred, too
vivid for that public place.&nbsp; On the two following, Frank
had himself been absent on some of his excursions among the
neighbouring families.&nbsp; It was not until the fourth,
accordingly, that Frank had occasion to set eyes on the
enchantress.&nbsp; With the first look, all hesitation was
over.&nbsp; She came with the Cauldstaneslap party; then she
lived at Cauldstaneslap.&nbsp; Here was Archie’s secret,
here was the woman, and more than that—though I have need
here of every manageable attenuation of language—with the
first look, he had already entered himself as rival.&nbsp; It was
a good deal in pique, it was a little in revenge, it was much in
genuine admiration: the devil may decide the proportions!&nbsp; I
cannot, and it is very likely that Frank could not.</p>
<p>“Mighty attractive milkmaid,” he observed, on the
way home.</p>
<p>“Who?” said Archie.</p>
<p>“O, the girl you’re looking at—aren’t
you?&nbsp; Forward there on the road.&nbsp; She came attended by
the rustic bard; presumably, therefore, belongs to his exalted
family.&nbsp; The single objection! for the four black brothers
are awkward customers.&nbsp; If anything were to go wrong, Gib
would gibber, and Clem would prove inclement; and Dand fly in
danders, and Hob blow up in gobbets.&nbsp; It would be a Helliott
of a business!”</p>
<p>“Very humorous, I am sure,” said Archie.</p>
<p>“Well, I am trying to be so,” said Frank.&nbsp;
“It’s none too easy in this place, and with your
solemn society, my dear fellow.&nbsp; But confess that the
milkmaid has found favour in your eyes, or resign all claim to be
a man of taste.”</p>
<p>“It is no matter,” returned Archie.</p>
<p>But the other continued to look at him, steadily and
quizzically, and his colour slowly rose and deepened under the
glance, until not impudence itself could have denied that he was
blushing.&nbsp; And at this Archie lost some of his
control.&nbsp; He changed his stick from one hand to the other,
and—“O, for God’s sake, don’t be an
ass!” he cried.</p>
<p>“Ass?&nbsp; That’s the retort delicate without
doubt,” says Frank.&nbsp; “Beware of the homespun
brothers, dear.&nbsp; If they come into the dance, you’ll
see who’s an ass.&nbsp; Think now, if they only applied
(say) a quarter as much talent as I have applied to the question
of what Mr. Archie does with his evening hours, and why he is so
unaffectedly nasty when the subject’s touched
on—”</p>
<p>“You are touching on it now,” interrupted Archie
with a wince.</p>
<p>“Thank you.&nbsp; That was all I wanted, an articulate
confession,” said Frank.</p>
<p>“I beg to remind you—” began Archie.</p>
<p>But he was interrupted in turn.&nbsp; “My dear fellow,
don’t.&nbsp; It’s quite needless.&nbsp; The
subject’s dead and buried.”</p>
<p>And Frank began to talk hastily on other matters, an art in
which he was an adept, for it was his gift to be fluent on
anything or nothing.&nbsp; But although Archie had the grace or
the timidity to suffer him to rattle on, he was by no means done
with the subject.&nbsp; When he came home to dinner, he was
greeted with a sly demand, how things were looking
“Cauldstaneslap ways.”&nbsp; Frank took his first
glass of port out after dinner to the toast of Kirstie, and later
in the evening he returned to the charge again.</p>
<p>“I say, Weir, you’ll excuse me for returning again
to this affair.&nbsp; I’ve been thinking it over, and I
wish to beg you very seriously to be more careful.&nbsp;
It’s not a safe business.&nbsp; Not safe, my boy,”
said he.</p>
<p>“What?” said Archie.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s your own fault if I must put a name on
the thing; but really, as a friend, I cannot stand by and see you
rushing head down into these dangers.&nbsp; My dear boy,”
said he, holding up a warning cigar, “consider!&nbsp; What
is to be the end of it?”</p>
<p>“The end of what?”—Archie, helpless with
irritation, persisted in this dangerous and ungracious guard.</p>
<p>“Well, the end of the milkmaid; or, to speak more by the
card, the end of Miss Christina Elliott of the
Cauldstaneslap.”</p>
<p>“I assure you,” Archie broke out, “this is
all a figment of your imagination.&nbsp; There is nothing to be
said against that young lady; you have no right to introduce her
name into the conversation.”</p>
<p>“I’ll make a note of it,” said Frank.&nbsp;
“She shall henceforth be nameless, nameless, nameless,
Grigalach!&nbsp; I make a note besides of your valuable testimony
to her character.&nbsp; I only want to look at this thing as a
man of the world.&nbsp; Admitted she’s an angel—but,
my good fellow, is she a lady?”</p>
<p>This was torture to Archie.&nbsp; “I beg your
pardon,” he said, struggling to be composed, “but
because you have wormed yourself into my
confidence—”</p>
<p>“O, come!” cried Frank.&nbsp; “Your
confidence?&nbsp; It was rosy but unconsenting.&nbsp; Your
confidence, indeed?&nbsp; Now, look!&nbsp; This is what I must
say, Weir, for it concerns your safety and good character, and
therefore my honour as your friend.&nbsp; You say I wormed myself
into your confidence.&nbsp; Wormed is good.&nbsp; But what have I
done?&nbsp; I have put two and two together, just as the parish
will be doing tomorrow, and the whole of Tweeddale in two weeks,
and the black brothers—well, I won’t put a date on
that; it will be a dark and stormy morning!&nbsp; Your secret, in
other words, is poor Poll’s.&nbsp; And I want to ask of you
as a friend whether you like the prospect?&nbsp; There are two
horns to your dilemma, and I must say for myself I should look
mighty ruefully on either.&nbsp; Do you see yourself explaining
to the four Black Brothers? or do you see yourself presenting the
milkmaid to papa as the future lady of Hermiston?&nbsp; Do
you?&nbsp; I tell you plainly, I don’t!”</p>
<p>Archie rose.&nbsp; “I will hear no more of this,”
he said, in a trembling voice.</p>
<p>But Frank again held up his cigar.&nbsp; “Tell me one
thing first.&nbsp; Tell me if this is not a friend’s part
that I am playing?”</p>
<p>“I believe you think it so,” replied Archle.&nbsp;
“I can go as far as that.&nbsp; I can do so much justice to
your motives.&nbsp; But I will hear no more of it.&nbsp; I am
going to bed.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, Weir,” said Frank
heartily.&nbsp; “Go to bed and think over it; and I say,
man, don’t forget your prayers!&nbsp; I don’t often
do the moral—don’t go in for that sort of
thing—but when I do there’s one thing sure, that I
mean it.”</p>
<p>So Archie marched off to bed, and Frank sat alone by the table
for another hour or so, smiling to himself richly.&nbsp; There
was nothing vindictive in his nature; but, if revenge came in his
way, it might as well be good, and the thought of Archie’s
pillow reflections that night was indescribably sweet to
him.&nbsp; He felt a pleasant sense of power.&nbsp; He looked
down on Archie as on a very little boy whose strings he
pulled—as on a horse whom he had backed and bridled by
sheer power of intelligence, and whom he might ride to glory or
the grave at pleasure.&nbsp; Which was it to be?&nbsp; He
lingered long, relishing the details of schemes that he was too
idle to pursue.&nbsp; Poor cork upon a torrent, he tasted that
night the sweets of omnipotence, and brooded like a deity over
the strands of that intrigue which was to shatter him before the
summer waned.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII—A NOCTURNAL VISIT</h2>
<p>Kirstie had many causes of distress.&nbsp; More and more as we
grow old—and yet more and more as we grow old and are
women, frozen by the fear of age—we come to rely on the
voice as the single outlet of the soul.&nbsp; Only thus, in the
curtailment of our means, can we relieve the straitened cry of
the passion within us; only thus, in the bitter and sensitive
shyness of advancing years, can we maintain relations with those
vivacious figures of the young that still show before us and tend
daily to become no more than the moving wall-paper of life.&nbsp;
Talk is the last link, the last relation.&nbsp; But with the end
of the conversation, when the voice stops and the bright face of
the listener is turned away, solitude falls again on the bruised
heart.&nbsp; Kirstie had lost her “cannie hour at
e’en”; she could no more wander with Archie, a ghost
if you will, but a happy ghost, in fields Elysian.&nbsp; And to
her it was as if the whole world had fallen silent; to him, but
an unremarkable change of amusements.&nbsp; And she raged to know
it.&nbsp; The effervescency of her passionate and irritable
nature rose within her at times to bursting point.</p>
<p>This is the price paid by age for unseasonable ardours of
feeling.&nbsp; It must have been so for Kirstie at any time when
the occasion chanced; but it so fell out that she was deprived of
this delight in the hour when she had most need of it, when she
had most to say, most to ask, and when she trembled to recognise
her sovereignty not merely in abeyance but annulled.&nbsp; For,
with the clairvoyance of a genuine love, she had pierced the
mystery that had so long embarrassed Frank.&nbsp; She was
conscious, even before it was carried out, even on that Sunday
night when it began, of an invasion of her rights; and a voice
told her the invader’s name.&nbsp; Since then, by arts, by
accident, by small things observed, and by the general drift of
Archie’s humour, she had passed beyond all possibility of
doubt.&nbsp; With a sense of justice that Lord Hermiston might
have envied, she had that day in church considered and admitted
the attractions of the younger Kirstie; and with the profound
humanity and sentimentality of her nature, she had recognised the
coming of fate.&nbsp; Not thus would she have chosen.&nbsp; She
had seen, in imagination, Archie wedded to some tall, powerful,
and rosy heroine of the golden locks, made in her own image, for
whom she would have strewed the bride-bed with delight; and now
she could have wept to see the ambition falsified.&nbsp; But the
gods had pronounced, and her doom was otherwise.</p>
<p>She lay tossing in bed that night, besieged with feverish
thoughts.&nbsp; There were dangerous matters pending, a battle
was toward, over the fate of which she hung in jealousy,
sympathy, fear, and alternate loyalty and disloyalty to either
side.&nbsp; Now she was reincarnated in her niece, and now in
Archie.&nbsp; Now she saw, through the girl’s eyes, the
youth on his knees to her, heard his persuasive instances with a
deadly weakness, and received his overmastering caresses.&nbsp;
Anon, with a revulsion, her temper raged to see such utmost
favours of fortune and love squandered on a brat of a girl, one
of her own house, using her own name—a deadly
ingredient—and that “didna ken her ain mind an’
was as black’s your hat.”&nbsp; Now she trembled lest
her deity should plead in vain, loving the idea of success for
him like a triumph of nature; anon, with returning loyalty to her
own family and sex, she trembled for Kirstie and the credit of
the Elliotts.&nbsp; And again she had a vision of herself, the
day over for her old-world tales and local gossip, bidding
farewell to her last link with life and brightness and love; and
behind and beyond, she saw but the blank butt-end where she must
crawl to die.&nbsp; Had she then come to the lees? she, so great,
so beautiful, with a heart as fresh as a girl’s and strong
as womanhood?&nbsp; It could not be, and yet it was so; and for a
moment her bed was horrible to her as the sides of the
grave.&nbsp; And she looked forward over a waste of hours, and
saw herself go on to rage, and tremble, and be softened, and rage
again, until the day came and the labours of the day must be
renewed.</p>
<p>Suddenly she heard feet on the stairs—his feet, and soon
after the sound of a window-sash flung open.&nbsp; She sat up
with her heart beating.&nbsp; He had gone to his room alone, and
he had not gone to bed.&nbsp; She might again have one of her
night cracks; and at the entrancing prospect, a change came over
her mind; with the approach of this hope of pleasure, all the
baser metal became immediately obliterated from her
thoughts.&nbsp; She rose, all woman, and all the best of woman,
tender, pitiful, hating the wrong, loyal to her own sex—and
all the weakest of that dear miscellany, nourishing, cherishing
next her soft heart, voicelessly flattering, hopes that she would
have died sooner than have acknowledged.&nbsp; She tore off her
nightcap, and her hair fell about her shoulders in
profusion.&nbsp; Undying coquetry awoke.&nbsp; By the faint light
of her nocturnal rush, she stood before the looking-glass,
carried her shapely arms above her head, and gathered up the
treasures of her tresses.&nbsp; She was never backward to admire
herself; that kind of modesty was a stranger to her nature; and
she paused, struck with a pleased wonder at the sight.&nbsp;
“Ye daft auld wife!” she said, answering a thought
that was not; and she blushed with the innocent consciousness of
a child.&nbsp; Hastily she did up the massive and shining coils,
hastily donned a wrapper, and with the rushlight in her hand,
stole into the hall.&nbsp; Below stairs she heard the clock
ticking the deliberate seconds, and Frank jingling with the
decanters in the dining-room.&nbsp; Aversion rose in her, bitter
and momentary.&nbsp; “Nesty, tippling puggy!” she
thought; and the next moment she had knocked guardedly at
Archie’s door and was bidden enter.</p>
<p>Archie had been looking out into the ancient blackness,
pierced here and there with a rayless star; taking the sweet air
of the moors and the night into his bosom deeply; seeking,
perhaps finding, peace after the manner of the unhappy.&nbsp; He
turned round as she came in, and showed her a pale face against
the window-frame.</p>
<p>“Is that you, Kirstie?” he asked.&nbsp;
“Come in!”</p>
<p>“It’s unco late, my dear,” said Kirstie,
affecting unwillingness.</p>
<p>“No, no,” he answered, “not at all.&nbsp;
Come in, if you want a crack.&nbsp; I am not sleepy, God
knows!”</p>
<p>She advanced, took a chair by the toilet table and the candle,
and set the rushlight at her foot.&nbsp; Something—it might
be in the comparative disorder of her dress, it might be the
emotion that now welled in her bosom—had touched her with a
wand of transformation, and she seemed young with the youth of
goddesses.</p>
<p>“Mr. Erchie,” she began, “what’s this
that’s come to ye?”</p>
<p>“I am not aware of anything that has come,” said
Archie, and blushed, and repented bitterly that he had let her
in.</p>
<p>“O, my dear, that’ll no dae!” said
Kirstie.&nbsp; “It’s ill to blend the eyes of
love.&nbsp; O, Mr. Erchie, tak a thocht ere it’s ower
late.&nbsp; Ye shouldna be impatient o’ the braws o’
life, they’ll a’ come in their saison, like the sun
and the rain.&nbsp; Ye’re young yet; ye’ve mony
cantie years afore ye.&nbsp; See and dinna wreck yersel’ at
the outset like sae mony ithers! Hae patience—they telled
me aye that was the owercome o’ life—hae patience,
there’s a braw day coming yet.&nbsp; Gude kens it never cam
to me; and here I am, wi’ nayther man nor bairn to
ca’ my ain, wearying a’ folks wi’ my ill
tongue, and you just the first, Mr. Erchie!”</p>
<p>“I have a difficulty in knowing what you mean,”
said Archie.</p>
<p>“Weel, and I’ll tell ye,” she said.&nbsp;
“It’s just this, that I’m feared.&nbsp;
I’m feared for ye, my dear.&nbsp; Remember, your faither is
a hard man, reaping where he hasna sowed and gaithering where he
hasna strawed.&nbsp; It’s easy speakin’, but
mind!&nbsp; Ye’ll have to look in the gurly face o’m,
where it’s ill to look, and vain to look for mercy.&nbsp;
Ye mind me o’ a bonny ship pitten oot into the black and
gowsty seas—ye’re a’ safe still, sittin’
quait and crackin’ wi’ Kirstie in your lown chalmer;
but whaur will ye be the morn, and in whatten horror o’ the
fearsome tempest, cryin’ on the hills to cover
ye?”</p>
<p>“Why, Kirstie, you’re very enigmatical
to-night—and very eloquent,” Archie put in.</p>
<p>“And, my dear Mr. Erchie,” she continued, with a
change of voice, “ye mauna think that I canna sympathise
wi’ ye.&nbsp; Ye mauna think that I havena been young
mysel’.&nbsp; Lang syne, when I was a bit lassie, no twenty
yet—”&nbsp; She paused and sighed.&nbsp; “Clean
and caller, wi’ a fit like the hinney bee,” she
continned.&nbsp; “I was aye big and buirdly, ye maun
understand; a bonny figure o’ a woman, though I say it that
suldna—built to rear bairns—braw bairns they suld hae
been, and grand I would hae likit it!&nbsp; But I was young,
dear, wi’ the bonny glint o’ youth in my e’en,
and little I dreamed I’d ever be tellin’ ye this, an
auld, lanely, rudas wife!&nbsp; Weel, Mr. Erchie, there was a lad
cam’ courtin’ me, as was but naetural.&nbsp; Mony had
come before, and I would nane o’ them.&nbsp; But this yin
had a tongue to wile the birds frae the lift and the bees frae
the foxglove bells.&nbsp; Deary me, but it’s lang
syne!&nbsp; Folk have dee’d sinsyne and been buried, and
are forgotten, and bairns been born and got merrit and got bairns
o’ their ain.&nbsp; Sinsyne woods have been plantit, and
have grawn up and are bonny trees, and the joes sit in their
shadow, and sinsyne auld estates have changed hands, and there
have been wars and rumours of wars on the face of the
earth.&nbsp; And here I’m still—like an auld droopit
craw—lookin’ on and craikin’!&nbsp; But, Mr.
Erchie, do ye no think that I have mind o’ it a’
still?&nbsp; I was dwalling then in my faither’s house; and
it’s a curious thing that we were whiles trysted in the
Deil’s Hags.&nbsp; And do ye no think that I have mind of
the bonny simmer days, the lang miles o’ the bluid-red
heather, the cryin’ of the whaups, and the lad and the
lassie that was trysted?&nbsp; Do ye no think that I mind how the
hilly sweetness ran about my hairt?&nbsp; Ay, Mr. Erchie, I ken
the way o’ it—fine do I ken the way—how the
grace o’ God takes them, like Paul of Tarsus, when they
think it least, and drives the pair o’ them into a land
which is like a dream, and the world and the folks
in’t’ are nae mair than clouds to the puir lassie,
and heeven nae mair than windle-straes, if she can but pleesure
him!&nbsp; Until Tam dee’d—that was my story,”
she broke off to say, “he dee’d, and I wasna at the
buryin’.&nbsp; But while he was here, I could take care
o’ mysel’.&nbsp; And can yon puir lassie?”</p>
<p>Kirstie, her eyes shining with unshed tears, stretched out her
hand towards him appealingly; the bright and the dull gold of her
hair flashed and smouldered in the coils behind her comely head,
like the rays of an eternal youth; the pure colour had risen in
her face; and Archie was abashed alike by her beauty and her
story.&nbsp; He came towards her slowly from the window, took up
her hand in his and kissed it.</p>
<p>“Kirstie,” he said hoarsely, “you have
misjudged me sorely.&nbsp; I have always thought of her, I
wouldna harm her for the universe, my woman!”</p>
<p>“Eh, lad, and that’s easy sayin’,”
cried Kirstie, “but it’s nane sae easy
doin’!&nbsp; Man, do ye no comprehend that it’s
God’s wull we should be blendit and glamoured, and have nae
command over our ain members at a time like that?&nbsp; My
bairn,” she cried, still holding his hand, “think
o’ the puir lass! have pity upon her, Erchie! and O, be
wise for twa! Think o’ the risk she rins!&nbsp; I have seen
ye, and what’s to prevent ithers!&nbsp; I saw ye once in
the Hags, in my ain howl, and I was wae to see ye there—in
pairt for the omen, for I think there’s a weird on the
place—and in pairt for pure nakit envy and bitterness
o’ hairt.&nbsp; It’s strange ye should forgather
there tae!&nbsp; God! but yon puir, thrawn, auld
Covenanter’s seen a heap o’ human natur since he
lookit his last on the musket barrels, if he never saw nane
afore,” she added, with a kind of wonder in her eyes.</p>
<p>“I swear by my honour I have done her no wrong,”
said Archie.&nbsp; “I swear by my honour and the redemption
of my soul that there shall none be done her.&nbsp; I have heard
of this before.&nbsp; I have been foolish, Kirstie, not unkind,
and, above all, not base.”</p>
<p>“There’s my bairn!” said Kirstie,
rising.&nbsp; “I’ll can trust ye noo, I’ll can
gang to my bed wi’ an easy hairt.”&nbsp; And then she
saw in a flash how barren had been her triumph.&nbsp; Archie had
promised to spare the girl, and he would keep it; but who had
promised to spare Archie?&nbsp; What was to be the end of
it?&nbsp; Over a maze of difficulties she glanced, and saw, at
the end of every passage, the flinty countenance of
Hermiston.&nbsp; And a kind of horror fell upon her at what she
had done.&nbsp; She wore a tragic mask.&nbsp; “Erchie, the
Lord peety you, dear, and peety me!&nbsp; I have buildit on this
foundation”—laying her hand heavily on his
shoulder—“and buildit hie, and pit my hairt in the
buildin’ of it.&nbsp; If the hale hypothec were to
fa’, I think, laddie, I would dee!&nbsp; Excuse a daft wife
that loves ye, and that kenned your mither.&nbsp; And for His
name’s sake keep yersel’ frae inordinate desires;
haud your heart in baith your hands, carry it canny and laigh;
dinna send it up like a hairn’s kite into the collieshangic
o’ the wunds!&nbsp; Mind, Maister Erchie dear, that this
life’s a’ disappointment, and a mouthfu’
o’ mools is the appointed end.”</p>
<p>“Ay, but Kirstie, my woman, you’re asking me ower
much at last,” said Archie, profoundly moved, and lapsing
into the broad Scots.&nbsp; “Ye’re asking what nae
man can grant ye, what only the Lord of heaven can grant ye if He
see fit.&nbsp; Ay!&nbsp; And can even He!&nbsp; I can promise ye
what I shall do, and you can depend on that.&nbsp; But how I
shall feel—my woman, that is long past thinking
of!”</p>
<p>They were both standing by now opposite each other.&nbsp; The
face of Archie wore the wretched semblance of a smile; hers was
convulsed for a moment.</p>
<p>“Promise me ae thing,” she cried in a sharp
voice.&nbsp; “Promise me ye’ll never do naething
without telling me.”</p>
<p>“No, Kirstie, I canna promise ye that,” he
replied.&nbsp; “I have promised enough, God
kens!”</p>
<p>“May the blessing of God lift and rest upon ye
dear!” she said.</p>
<p>“God bless ye, my old friend,” said he.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX—AT THE WEAVER’S STONE</h2>
<p>It was late in the afternoon when Archie drew near by the hill
path to the Praying Weaver’s stone.&nbsp; The Hags were in
shadow.&nbsp; But still, through the gate of the Slap, the sun
shot a last arrow, which sped far and straight across the surface
of the moss, here and there touching and shining on a tussock,
and lighted at length on the gravestone and the small figure
awaiting him there.&nbsp; The emptiness and solitude of the great
moors seemed to be concentrated there, and Kirstie pointed out by
that figure of sunshine for the only inhabitant.&nbsp; His first
sight of her was thus excruciatingly sad, like a glimpse of a
world from which all light, comfort, and society were on the
point of vanishing.&nbsp; And the next moment, when she had
turned her face to him and the quick smile had enlightened it,
the whole face of nature smiled upon him in her smile of
welcome.&nbsp; Archie’s slow pace was quickened; his legs
hasted to her though his heart was hanging back.&nbsp; The girl,
upon her side, drew herself together slowly and stood up,
expectant; she was all languor, her face was gone white; her arms
ached for him, her soul was on tip-toes.&nbsp; But he deceived
her, pausing a few steps away, not less white than herself, and
holding up his hand with a gesture of denial.</p>
<p>“No, Christina, not to-day,” he said.&nbsp;
“To-day I have to talk to you seriously.&nbsp; Sit ye down,
please, there where you were.&nbsp; Please!” he
repeated.</p>
<p>The revulsion of feeling in Christina’s heart was
violent.&nbsp; To have longed and waited these weary hours for
him, rehearsing her endearments—to have seen him at last
come—to have been ready there, breathless, wholly passive,
his to do what he would with—and suddenly to have found
herself confronted with a grey-faced, harsh schoolmaster—it
was too rude a shock.&nbsp; She could have wept, but pride
withheld her.&nbsp; She sat down on the stone, from which she had
arisen, part with the instinct of obedience, part as though she
had been thrust there.&nbsp; What was this? Why was she
rejected?&nbsp; Had she ceased to please?&nbsp; She stood here
offering her wares, and he would none of them!&nbsp; And yet they
were all his!&nbsp; His to take and keep, not his to refuse
though!&nbsp; In her quick petulant nature, a moment ago on fire
with hope, thwarted love and wounded vanity wrought.&nbsp; The
schoolmaster that there is in all men, to the despair of all
girls and most women, was now completely in possession of
Archie.&nbsp; He had passed a night of sermons, a day of
reflection; he had come wound up to do his duty; and the set
mouth, which in him only betrayed the effort of his will, to her
seemed the expression of an averted heart.&nbsp; It was the same
with his constrained voice and embarrassed utterance; and if
so—if it was all over—the pang of the thought took
away from her the power of thinking.</p>
<p>He stood before her some way off.&nbsp; “Kirstie,
there’s been too much of this.&nbsp; We’ve seen too
much of each other.”&nbsp; She looked up quickly and her
eyes contracted.&nbsp; “There’s no good ever comes of
these secret meetings.&nbsp; They’re not frank, not honest
truly, and I ought to have seen it.&nbsp; People have begun to
talk; and it’s not right of me.&nbsp; Do you
see?”</p>
<p>“I see somebody will have been talking to ye,” she
said sullenly.</p>
<p>“They have, more than one of them,” replied
Archie.</p>
<p>“And whae were they?” she cried.&nbsp; “And
what kind o’ love do ye ca’ that, that’s ready
to gang round like a whirligig at folk talking?&nbsp; Do ye think
they havena talked to me?”</p>
<p>“Have they indeed?” said Archie, with a quick
breath.&nbsp; “That is what I feared.&nbsp; Who were
they?&nbsp; Who has dared—?”</p>
<p>Archie was on the point of losing his temper.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, not any one had talked to Christina on
the matter; and she strenuously repeated her own first question
in a panic of self-defence.</p>
<p>“Ah, well! what does it matter?” he said.&nbsp;
“They were good folk that wished well to us, and the great
affair is that there are people talking.&nbsp; My dear girl, we
have to be wise.&nbsp; We must not wreck our lives at the
outset.&nbsp; They may be long and happy yet, and we must see to
it, Kirstie, like God’s rational creatures and not like
fool children.&nbsp; There is one thing we must see to before
all.&nbsp; You’re worth waiting for, Kirstie! worth waiting
for a generation; it would be enough reward.”—And
here he remembered the schoolmaster again, and very unwisely took
to following wisdom.&nbsp; “The first thing that we must
see to, is that there shall be no scandal about for my
father’s sake.&nbsp; That would ruin all; do ye no see
that?”</p>
<p>Kirstie was a little pleased, there had been some show of
warmth of sentiment in what Archie had said last.&nbsp; But the
dull irritation still persisted in her bosom; with the aboriginal
instinct, having suffered herself, she wished to make Archie
suffer.</p>
<p>And besides, there had come out the word she had always feared
to hear from his lips, the name of his father.&nbsp; It is not to
be supposed that, during so many days with a love avowed between
them, some reference had not been made to their conjoint
future.&nbsp; It had in fact been often touched upon, and from
the first had been the sore point.&nbsp; Kirstie had wilfully
closed the eye of thought; she would not argue even with herself;
gallant, desperate little heart, she had accepted the command of
that supreme attraction like the call of fate and marched
blindfold on her doom.&nbsp; But Archie, with his masculine sense
of responsibility, must reason; he must dwell on some future
good, when the present good was all in all to Kirstie; he must
talk—and talk lamely, as necessity drove him—of what
was to be.&nbsp; Again and again he had touched on marriage;
again and again been driven back into indistinctness by a memory
of Lord Hermiston.&nbsp; And Kirstie had been swift to understand
and quick to choke down and smother the understanding; swift to
leap up in flame at a mention of that hope, which spoke volumes
to her vanity and her love, that she might one day be Mrs. Weir
of Hermiston; swift, also, to recognise in his stumbling or
throttled utterance the death-knell of these expectations, and
constant, poor girl! in her large-minded madness, to go on and to
reck nothing of the future.&nbsp; But these unfinished
references, these blinks in which his heart spoke, and his memory
and reason rose up to silence it before the words were well
uttered, gave her unqualifiable agony.&nbsp; She was raised up
and dashed down again bleeding.&nbsp; The recurrence of the
subject forced her, for however short a time, to open her eyes on
what she did not wish to see; and it had invariably ended in
another disappointment.&nbsp; So now again, at the mere wind of
its coming, at the mere mention of his father’s
name—who might seem indeed to have accompanied them in
their whole moorland courtship, an awful figure in a wig with an
ironical and bitter smile, present to guilty
consciousness—she fled from it head down.</p>
<p>“Ye havena told me yet,” she said, “who was
it spoke?”</p>
<p>“Your aunt for one,” said Archie.</p>
<p>“Auntie Kirstie?” she cried.&nbsp; “And what
do I care for my Auntie Kirstie?”</p>
<p>“She cares a great deal for her niece,” replied
Archie, in kind reproof.</p>
<p>“Troth, and it’s the first I’ve heard of
it,” retorted the girl.</p>
<p>“The question here is not who it is, but what they say,
what they have noticed,” pursued the lucid
schoolmaster.&nbsp; “That is what we have to think of in
self-defence.”</p>
<p>“Auntie Kirstie, indeed!&nbsp; A bitter, thrawn auld
maid that’s fomented trouble in the country before I was
born, and will be doing it still, I daur say, when I’m
deid!&nbsp; It’s in her nature; it’s as natural for
her as it’s for a sheep to eat.”</p>
<p>“Pardon me, Kirstie, she was not the only one,”
interposed Archie.&nbsp; “I had two warnings, two sermons,
last night, both most kind and considerate.&nbsp; Had you been
there, I promise you you would have grat, my dear!&nbsp; And they
opened my eyes.&nbsp; I saw we were going a wrong way.”</p>
<p>“Who was the other one?” Kirstie demanded.</p>
<p>By this time Archie was in the condition of a hunted
beast.&nbsp; He had come, braced and resolute; he was to trace
out a line of conduct for the pair of them in a few cold,
convincing sentences; he had now been there some time, and he was
still staggering round the outworks and undergoing what he felt
to be a savage cross-examination.</p>
<p>“Mr. Frank!” she cried.&nbsp; “What
nex’, I would like to ken?”</p>
<p>“He spoke most kindly and truly.”</p>
<p>“What like did he say?”</p>
<p>“I am not going to tell you; you have nothing to do with
that,” cried Archie, startled to find he had admitted so
much.</p>
<p>“O, I have naething to do with it!” she repeated,
springing to her feet.&nbsp; “A’body at
Hermiston’s free to pass their opinions upon me, but I have
naething to do wi’ it!&nbsp; Was this at prayers
like?&nbsp; Did ye ca’ the grieve into the
consultation?&nbsp; Little wonder if a’body’s
talking, when ye make a’body yer confidants!&nbsp; But as
you say, Mr. Weir,—most kindly, most considerately, most
truly, I’m sure,—I have naething to do with it.&nbsp;
And I think I’ll better be going.&nbsp; I’ll be
wishing you good evening, Mr. Weir.”&nbsp; And she made him
a stately curtsey, shaking as she did so from head to foot, with
the barren ecstasy of temper.</p>
<p>Poor Archie stood dumbfounded.&nbsp; She had moved some steps
away from him before he recovered the gift of articulate
speech.</p>
<p>“Kirstie!” he cried.&nbsp; “O, Kirstie
woman!”</p>
<p>There was in his voice a ring of appeal, a clang of mere
astonishment that showed the schoolmaster was vanquished.</p>
<p>She turned round on him.&nbsp; “What do ye Kirstie me
for?” she retorted.&nbsp; “What have ye to do
wi’ me!&nbsp; Gang to your ain freends and deave
them!”</p>
<p>He could only repeat the appealing “Kirstie!”</p>
<p>“Kirstie, indeed!” cried the girl, her eyes
blazing in her white face.&nbsp; “My name is Miss Christina
Elliott, I would have ye to ken, and I daur ye to ca’ me
out of it.&nbsp; If I canna get love, I’ll have respect,
Mr. Weir.&nbsp; I’m come of decent people, and I’ll
have respect.&nbsp; What have I done that ye should lightly
me?&nbsp; What have I done?&nbsp; What have I done? O, what have
I done?” and her voice rose upon the third
repetition.&nbsp; “I thocht—I thocht—I thocht I
was sae happy!” and the first sob broke from her like the
paroxysm of some mortal sickness.</p>
<p>Archie ran to her.&nbsp; He took the poor child in his arms,
and she nestled to his breast as to a mother’s, and clasped
him in hands that were strong like vices.&nbsp; He felt her whole
body shaken by the throes of distress, and had pity upon her
beyond speech.&nbsp; Pity, and at the same time a bewildered fear
of this explosive engine in his arms, whose works he did not
understand, and yet had been tampering with.&nbsp; There arose
from before him the curtains of boyhood, and he saw for the first
time the ambiguous face of woman as she is.&nbsp; In vain he
looked back over the interview; he saw not where he had
offended.&nbsp; It seemed unprovoked, a wilful convulsion of
brute nature. . . .</p>
<h2><!-- page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>EDITORIAL NOTE</h2>
<p>With the words last printed, “a wilful convulsion of
brute nature,” the romance of <i>Weir of Hermiston</i>
breaks off.&nbsp; They were dictated, I believe, on the very
morning of the writer’s sudden seizure and death.&nbsp;
<i>Weir of Hermiston</i> thus remains in the work of Stevenson
what <i>Edwin Droid</i> is in the work of Dickens or <i>Denis
Duval</i> in that of Thackeray: or rather it remains relatively
more, for if each of those fragments holds an honourable place
among its author’s writings, among Stevenson’s the
fragment of <i>Weir</i> holds certainly the highest.</p>
<p>Readers may be divided in opinion on the question whether they
would or they would not wish to hear more of the intended course
of the story and destinies of the characters.&nbsp; To some,
silence may seem best, and that the mind should be left to its
own conjectures as to the sequel, with the help of such
indications as the text affords.&nbsp; I confess that this is the
view which has my sympathy.&nbsp; But since others, and those
almost certainly a majority, are anxious to be told all they can,
and since editors and publishers join in the request, I can
scarce do otherwise than comply.&nbsp; The intended argument,
then, so far as it was known at the time of the writer’s
death to his step-daughter and devoted amanuensis, Mrs. Strong,
was nearly as follows:—</p>
<p>Archie persists in his good resolution of avoiding further
conduct compromising to young Kirstie’s good <!-- page
169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>name.&nbsp; Taking advantage of the situation thus
created, and of the girl’s unhappiness and wounded vanity,
Frank Innes pursues his purpose of seduction; and Kirstie, though
still caring for Archie in her heart, allows herself to become
Frank’s victim.&nbsp; Old Kirstie is the first to perceive
something amiss with her, and believing Archie to be the culprit,
accuses him, thus making him aware for the first time that
mischief has happened.&nbsp; He does not at once deny the charge,
but seeks out and questions young Kirstie, who confesses the
truth to him; and he, still loving her, promises to protect and
defend her in her trouble.&nbsp; He then has an interview with
Frank Innes on the moor, which ends in a quarrel, and in Archie
killing Frank beside the Weaver’s Stone.&nbsp; Meanwhile
the Four Black Brothers, having become aware of their
sister’s betrayal, are bent on vengeance against Archie as
her supposed seducer.&nbsp; They are about to close in upon him
with this purpose when he is arrested by the officers of the law
for the murder of Frank.&nbsp; He is tried before his own father,
the Lord Justice-Clerk, found guilty, and condemned to
death.&nbsp; Meanwhile the elder Kirstie, having discovered from
the girl how matters really stand, informs her nephews of the
truth; and they, in a great revulsion of feeling in
Archie’s favour, determine on an action after the ancient
manner of their house.&nbsp; They gather a following, and after a
great fight break the prison where Archie lies confined, and
rescue him.&nbsp; He and young Kirstie thereafter escape to
America.&nbsp; But the ordeal of taking part in the trial of his
own son has been too much for the Lord Justice-Clerk, who dies of
the shock.&nbsp; “I do not know,” adds the
amanuensis, “what becomes of old Kirstie, but that
character grew and strengthened so in the writing that I am sure
he had some dramatic destiny for her.”</p>
<p><!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>The plan of every imaginative work is subject, of
course, to change under the artist’s hand as he carries it
out; and not merely the character of the elder Kirstie, but other
elements of the design no less, might well have deviated from the
lines originally traced.&nbsp; It seems certain, however, that
the next stage in the relations of Archie and the younger Kirstie
would have been as above foreshadowed; and this conception of the
lover’s unconventional chivalry and unshaken devotion to
his mistress after her fault is very characteristic of the
writer’s mind.&nbsp; The vengeance to be taken on the
seducer beside the Weaver’s Stone is prepared for in the
first words of the Introduction; while the situation and fate of
the judge, confronting like a Brutus, but unable to survive, the
duty of sending his own son to the gallows, seem clearly to have
been destined to furnish the climax and essential tragedy of the
tale.</p>
<p>How this last circumstance was to have been brought about,
within the limits of legal usage and possibility, seems hard to
conjecture; but it was a point to which the author had evidently
given careful consideration.&nbsp; Mrs. Strong says simply that
the Lord Justice-Clerk, like an old Roman, condemns his son to
death; but I am assured on the best legal authority of Scotland
that no judge, however powerful either by character or office,
could have insisted on presiding at the trial of a near kinsman
of his own.&nbsp; The Lord Justice-Clerk was head of the criminal
justiciary of the country; he might have insisted on his right of
being present on the bench when his son was tried: but he would
never have been allowed to preside or to pass sentence.&nbsp; Now
in a letter of Stevenson’s to Mr. Baxter, of October 1892,
I find him asking for materials in terms which seem to indicate
that he knew this quite well:—“I wish
Pitcairn’s ‘Criminal Trials,’ <i>quam
primum</i>.&nbsp; Also an absolutely correct text <!-- page
171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>of
the Scots judiciary oath.&nbsp; Also, in case Pitcairn does not
come down late enough, I wish as full a report as possible of a
Scots murder trial between 1790–1820.&nbsp; Understand the
<i>fullest possible</i>.&nbsp; Is there any book which would
guide me to the following facts?&nbsp; The Justice-Clerk tries
some people capitally on circuit.&nbsp; Certain evidence cropping
up, the charge is transferred to the Justice-Clerk’s own
son.&nbsp; Of course in the next trial the Justice-Clerk is
excluded, and the case is called before the Lord
Justice-General.&nbsp; Where would this trial have to be?&nbsp; I
fear in Edinburgh, which would not suit my view.&nbsp; Could it
be again at the circuit town?”&nbsp; The point was referred
to a quondam fellow-member with Stevenson of the Edinburgh
Speculative Society, Mr. Graham Murray, the present
Solicitor-General for Scotland; whose reply was to the effect
that there would be no difficulty in making the new trial take
place at the circuit town; that it would have to be held there in
spring or autumn, before two Lords of Justiciary; and that the
Lord Justice-General would have nothing to do with it, this title
being at the date in question only a nominal one held by a layman
(which is no longer the case).&nbsp; On this Stevenson writes,
“Graham Murray’s note <i>re</i> the venue was highly
satisfactory, and did me all the good in the world.”&nbsp;
The terms of his inquiry seem to imply that he intended other
persons, before Archie, to have fallen first under suspicion of
the murder; and also—doubtless in order to make the rescue
by the Black Brothers possible—that he wanted Archie to be
imprisoned not in Edinburgh but in the circuit town.&nbsp; But
they do not show how he meant to get over the main difficulty,
which at the same time he fully recognises.&nbsp; Can it have
been that Lord Hermiston’s part was to have been limited to
presiding at the <i>first</i> trial, where the evidence
incriminating Archie was unexpectedly <!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>brought
forward, and to directing that the law should take its
course?</p>
<p>Whether the final escape and union of Archie and Christina
would have proved equally essential to the plot may perhaps to
some readers seem questionable.&nbsp; They may rather feel that a
tragic destiny is foreshadowed from the beginning for all
concerned, and is inherent in the very conditions of the
tale.&nbsp; But on this point, and other matters of general
criticism connected with it, I find an interesting discussion by
the author himself in his correspondence.&nbsp; Writing to Mr. J.
M. Barrie, under date November 1, 1892, and criticising that
author’s famous story of <i>The Little Minister</i>,
Stevenson says:—</p>
<p>“Your descriptions of your dealings with Lord Rintoul
are frightfully unconscientious. . . .&nbsp; The <i>Little
Minister</i> ought to have ended badly; we all know it
<i>did</i>, and we are infinitely grateful to you for the grace
and good feeling with which you have lied about it.&nbsp; If you
had told the truth, I for one could never have forgiven
you.&nbsp; As you had conceived and written the earlier parts,
the truth about the end, though indisputably true to fact, would
have been a lie, or what is worse, a discord, in art.&nbsp; If
you are going to make a book end badly, it must end badly from
the beginning.&nbsp; Now, your book began to end well.&nbsp; You
let yourself fall in love with, and fondle, and smile at your
puppets.&nbsp; Once you had done that, your honour was
committed—at the cost of truth to life you were bound to
save them.&nbsp; It is the blot on <i>Richard Feverel</i> for
instance, that it begins to end well; and then tricks you and
ends ill.&nbsp; But in this case, there is worse behind, for the
ill ending does not inherently issue from the plot—the
story had, in fact, ended well after the great last interview
between Richard and Lucy—and the blind, illogical bullet
which smashes all has no more to do between the boards than a fly
has to do with a room <!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>into whose open window it comes
buzzing.&nbsp; It might have so happened; it needed not; and
unless needs must, we have no right to pain our readers.&nbsp; I
have had a heavy case of conscience of the same kind about my
Braxfield story.&nbsp; Braxfield—only his name is
Hermiston—has a son who is condemned to death; plainly
there is a fine tempting fitness about this—and I meant he
was to hang.&nbsp; But on considering my minor characters, I saw
there were five people who would—in a sense, who
must—break prison and attempt his rescue.&nbsp; They are
capable hardy folks too, who might very well succeed.&nbsp; Why
should they not then?&nbsp; Why should not young Hermiston escape
clear out of the country? and be happy, if he could, with
his—but soft!&nbsp; I will not betray my secret nor my
heroine. . . .”</p>
<p>To pass, now, from the question how the story would have ended
to the question how it originated and grew in the writer’s
mind.&nbsp; The character of the hero, Weir of Hermiston, is
avowedly suggested by the historical personality of Robert
Macqueen, Lord Braxfield.&nbsp; This famous judge has been for
generations the subject of a hundred Edinburgh tales and
anecdotes.&nbsp; Readers of Stevenson’s essay on the
Raeburn exhibition, in <i>Virginibus Puerisque</i>, will remember
how he is fascinated by Raeburn’s portrait of Braxfield,
even as Lockhart had been fascinated by a different portrait of
the same worthy sixty years before (see <i>Peter’s Letters
to his Kinsfolk</i>); nor did his interest in the character
diminish in later life.&nbsp; Again, the case of a judge involved
by the exigencies of his office in a strong conflict between
public duty and private interest or affection, was one which had
always attracted and exercised Stevenson’s
imagination.&nbsp; In the days when he and Mr. Henley were
collaborating with a view to the stage, Mr. Henley once proposed
a plot founded on the story of Mr. Justice Harbottle in Sheridan
<!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>Le Fanu’s <i>In a Glass Darkly</i>, in which the
wicked judge goes headlong <i>per fas et nefas</i> to his object
of getting the husband of his mistress hanged.&nbsp; Some time
later Stevenson and his wife together wrote a play called <i>The
Hanging Judge</i>.&nbsp; In this, the title character is tempted
for the first time in his life to tamper with the course of
justice, in order to shield his wife from persecution by a former
husband who reappears after being supposed dead.&nbsp;
Bulwer’s novel of <i>Paul Clifford</i>, with its final
situation of the worldly-minded judge, Sir William Brandon,
learning that the highwayman whom he is in the act of sentencing
is his own son, and dying of the knowledge, was also well known
to Stevenson, and no doubt counted for something in the
suggestion of the present story.</p>
<p>Once more, the difficulties often attending the relation of
father and son in actual life had pressed heavily on
Stevenson’s mind and conscience from the days of his youth,
when in obeying the law of his own nature he had been constrained
to disappoint, distress, and for a time to be much misunderstood
by, a father whom he justly loved and admired with all his
heart.&nbsp; Difficulties of this kind he had already handled in
a lighter vein once or twice in fiction—as for instance in
the <i>Story of a Lie</i> and in <i>The Wrecker</i>—before
he grappled with them in the acute and tragic phase in which they
occur in the present story.</p>
<p>These three elements, then, the interest of the historical
personality of Lord Braxfield, the problems and emotions arising
from a violent conflict between duty and nature in a judge, and
the difficulties due to incompatibility and misunderstanding
between father and son, lie at the foundations of the present
story.&nbsp; To touch on minor matters, it is perhaps worth
notice, as Mr. Henley reminds me, that the name of Weir had from
of old a special <!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>significance for Stevenson’s
imagination, from the traditional fame in Edinburgh of Major
Weir, burned as a warlock, together with his sister, under
circumstances of peculiar atrocity.&nbsp; Another name, that of
the episodical personage of Mr. Torrance the minister, is
borrowed direct from life, as indeed are the whole figure and its
surroundings—kirkyard, kirk, and manse—down even to
the black thread mittens: witness the following passage from a
letter of the early seventies:—“I’ve been to
church and am not depressed—a great step.&nbsp; It was at
that beautiful church” [of Glencorse in the Pentlands,
three miles from his father’s country house at
Swanston].&nbsp; “It is a little cruciform place, with a
steep slate roof.&nbsp; The small kirkyard is full of old
grave-stones; one of a Frenchman from Dunkerque, I suppose he
died prisoner in the military prison hard by.&nbsp; And one, the
most pathetic memorial I ever saw: a poor school-slate, in a
wooden frame, with the inscription cut into it evidently by the
father’s own hand.&nbsp; In church, old Mr. Torrance
preached, over eighty and a relic of times forgotten, with his
black thread gloves and mild old face.”&nbsp; A side hint
for a particular trait in the character of Mrs. Weir we can trace
in some family traditions concerning the writer’s own
grandmother, who is reported to have valued piety much more than
efficiency in her domestic servants.&nbsp; The other women
characters seem, so far at least as I know, to have been pure
creation, and especially that new and admirable incarnation of
the eternal feminine in the elder Kirstie.&nbsp; The little that
he says about her himself is in a letter written a few days
before his death to Mr. Gosse.&nbsp; The allusions are to the
various moods and attitudes of people in regard to middle age,
and are suggested by Mr. Gosse’s volume of poems, <i>In
Russet and Silver</i>.&nbsp; “It seems rather funny,”
he writes, “that this matter should come up just now, as I
am at present <!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>engaged in treating a severe case of
middle age in one of my stories, <i>The Justice-Clerk</i>.&nbsp;
The case is that of a woman, and I think I am doing her
justice.&nbsp; You will be interested, I believe, to see the
difference in our treatments.&nbsp; <i>Secreta Vitæ</i>
[the title of one of Mr. Gosse’s poems] comes nearer to the
case of my poor Kirstie.”&nbsp; From the wonderful midnight
scene between her and Archie, we may judge what we have lost in
those later scenes where she was to have taxed him with the fault
that was not his—to have presently learned his innocence
from the lips of his supposed victim—to have then
vindicated him to her kinsmen and fired them to the action of his
rescue.&nbsp; The scene of the prison-breaking here planned by
Stevenson would have gained interest (as will already have
occurred to readers) from comparison with the two famous
precedents in Scott, the Porteous mob and the breaking of
Portanferry jail.</p>
<p>The best account of Stevenson’s methods of imaginative
work is in the following sentences from a letter of his own to
Mr. W. Craibe Angus of Glasgow:—“I am still ‘a
slow study,’ and sit for a long while silent on my
eggs.&nbsp; Unconscious thought, there is the only method:
macerate your subject, let it boil slow, then take the lid off
and look in—and there your stuff is—good or
bad.”&nbsp; The several elements above noted having been
left to work for many years in his mind, it was in the autumn of
1892 that he was moved to “take the lid off and look
in,”—under the influence, it would seem, of a special
and overmastering wave of that feeling for the romance of
Scottish scenery and character which was at all times so strong
in him, and which his exile did so much to intensify.&nbsp; I
quote again from his letter to Mr. Barrie on November 1st in that
year:—“It is a singular thing that I should live here
in the South Seas under conditions so new and so striking, and
yet my imagination so continually inhabit the cold <!-- page
177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>old huddle of grey hills from which we come.&nbsp; I
have finished <i>David Balfour</i>, I have another book on the
stocks, <i>The Young Chevalier</i>, which is to be part in France
and part in Scotland, and to deal with Prince Charlie about the
year 1749; and now what have I done but begun a third, which is
to be all moorland together, and is to have for a centre-piece a
figure that I think you will appreciate—that of the
immortal Braxfield.&nbsp; Braxfield himself is my grand
premier—or since you are so much involved in the British
drama, let me say my heavy lead.”&nbsp; Writing to me at
the same date he makes the same announcement more briefly, with a
list of the characters and an indication of the scene and date of
the story.&nbsp; To Mr. Baxter he writes a month later, “I
have a novel on the stocks to be called <i>The
Justice-Clerk</i>.&nbsp; It is pretty Scotch; the grand premier
is taken from Braxfield (O, by the by, send me Cockburn’s
<i>Memorials</i>), and some of the story is, well, queer.&nbsp;
The heroine is seduced by one man, and finally disappears with
the other man who shot him. . . .&nbsp; Mind you, I expect <i>The
Justice-Clerk</i> to be my masterpiece.&nbsp; My Braxfield is
already a thing of beauty and a joy for ever, and so far as he
has gone, far my best character.”&nbsp; From the last
extract it appears that he had already at this date drafted some
of the earlier chapters of the book.&nbsp; He also about the same
time composed the dedication to his wife, who found it pinned to
her bed-curtains one morning on awaking.&nbsp; It was always his
habit to keep several books in progress at the same time, turning
from one to another as the fancy took him, and finding relief in
the change of labour; and for many months after the date of this
letter, first illness,—then a voyage to
Auckland,—then work on the <i>Ebb-Tide</i>, on a new tale
called <i>St. Ives</i>, which was begun during an attack of
influenza, and on his projected book of family
history,—prevented his making any continuous progress <!--
page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>with <i>Weir</i>.&nbsp; In August 1893 he says he has
been recasting the beginning.&nbsp; A year later, still only the
first four or five chapters had been drafted.&nbsp; Then, in the
last weeks of his life, he attacked the task again, in a sudden
heat of inspiration, and worked at it ardently and without
interruption until the end came.&nbsp; No wonder if during these
weeks he was sometimes aware of a tension of the spirit difficult
to sustain.&nbsp; “How can I keep this pitch?” he is
reported to have said after finishing one of the chapters; and
all the world knows how that frail organism in fact betrayed him
in mid effort.&nbsp; The greatness of the loss to his
country’s letters can for the first time be fully measured
from the foregoing pages.</p>
<p>There remains one more point to be mentioned, as to the speech
and manners of the Hanging Judge himself.&nbsp; That these are
not a whit exaggerated, in comparison with what is recorded of
his historic prototype, Lord Braxfield, is certain.&nbsp; The
<i>locus classicus</i> in regard to this personage is in Lord
Cockburn’s <i>Memorials of his Time</i>.&nbsp;
“Strong built and dark, with rough eyebrows, powerful eyes,
threatening lips, and a low growling voice, he was like a
formidable blacksmith.&nbsp; His accent and dialect were
exaggerated Scotch; his language, like his thoughts, short,
strong, and conclusive.&nbsp; Illiterate and without any taste
for any refined enjoyment, strength of understanding, which gave
him power without cultivation, only encouraged him to a more
contemptuous disdain of all natures less coarse than his
own.&nbsp; It may be doubted if he was ever so much in his
element as when tauntingly repelling the last despairing claim of
a wretched culprit, and sending him to Botany Bay or the gallows
with an insulting jest.&nbsp; Yet this was not from cruelty, for
which he was too strong and too jovial, but from cherished
coarseness.”&nbsp; Readers, nevertheless, who are at all
acquainted with the social history of Scotland will hardly <!--
page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>have failed to make the observation that
Braxfield’s is an extreme case of eighteenth-century
manners, as he himself was an eighteenth-century personage (he
died in 1799, in his seventy-eighth year); and that for the date
in which the story is cast (1814) such manners are somewhat of an
anachronism.&nbsp; During the generation contemporary with the
French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars—or to put it
another way, the generation that elapsed between the days when
Scott roamed the country as a High School and University student
and those when he settled in the fulness of fame and prosperity
at Abbotsford,—or again (the allusions will appeal to
readers of the admirable Galt) during the interval between the
first and the last provostry of Bailie Pawkie in the borough of
Gudetown, or between the earlier and the final ministrations of
Mr. Balwhidder in the parish of Dalmailing,—during this
period a great softening had taken place in Scottish manners
generally, and in those of the Bar and Bench not least.&nbsp;
“Since the death of Lord Justice-Clerk Macqueen of
Braxfield,” says Lockhart, writing about 1817, “the
whole exterior of judicial deportment has been quite
altered.”&nbsp; A similar criticism may probably hold good
on the picture of border life contained in the chapter concerning
the Four Black Brothers of Cauldstaneslap, namely, that it rather
suggests the ways of an earlier generation; nor have I any clue
to the reasons which led Stevenson to choose this particular
date, in the year preceding Waterloo, for a story which, in
regard to some of its features at least, might seem more
naturally placed some twenty-five or thirty years before.</p>
<p>If the reader seeks, further, to know whether the scenery of
Hermiston can be identified with any one special place familiar
to the writer’s early experience, the answer, I think, must
be in the negative.&nbsp; Rather it is distilled from a number of
different haunts and associations among the <!-- page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>moorlands
of southern Scotland.&nbsp; In the dedication and in a letter to
me he indicates the Lammermuirs as the scene of his
tragedy.&nbsp; And Mrs. Stevenson (his mother) tells me that she
thinks he was inspired by recollections of a visit paid in
boyhood to an uncle living at a remote farmhouse in that district
called Overshiels, in the parish of Stow.&nbsp; But though he may
have thought of the Lammermuirs in the first instance, we have
already found him drawing his description of the kirk and manse
from another haunt of his youth, namely, Glencorse in the
Pentlands; while passages in chapters v. and viii. point
explicitly to a third district, that is, Upper Tweeddale, with
the country stretching thence towards the wells of Clyde.&nbsp;
With this country also holiday rides and excursions from Peebles
had made him familiar as a boy: and this seems certainly the most
natural scene of the story, if only from its proximity to the
proper home of the Elliotts, which of course is in the heart of
the Border, especially Teviotdale and Ettrick.&nbsp; Some of the
geographical names mentioned are clearly not meant to furnish
literal indications.&nbsp; The Spango, for instance, is a water
running, I believe, not into the Tweed but into the Nith, and
Crossmichael as the name of a town is borrowed from Galloway.</p>
<p>But it is with the general and essential that the artist
deals, and questions of strict historical perspective or local
definition are beside the mark in considering his work.&nbsp; Nor
will any reader expect, or be grateful for, comment in this place
on matters which are more properly to the point—on the
seizing and penetrating power of the author’s ripened art
as exhibited in the foregoing pages, the wide range of character
and emotion over which he sweeps with so assured a hand, his
vital poetry of vision and magic of presentment.&nbsp; Surely no
son of Scotland has died leaving with his last breath a worthier
tribute to the land he loved.</p>
