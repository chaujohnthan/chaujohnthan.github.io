<p>i am going to start to read a book named the mueller report by wpost which i borrowed yesterday from szlib, bill clinton will be tired of waiting, so i may go to sleep then.</p>
<p>
03:30AM, i felt like bill might have gone to save an african from famine, so i decided to go to bed. nope, i was woken up at 04:24am again.
</p>
<p>
now it is 07:42am, due to loss of sleep, i will have to sleep at noon today for serveral hours more instead of an one-hour nap.
